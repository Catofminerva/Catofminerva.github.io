<h1>Wounded Child No Survivng Family</h1>

<p>This week in the Gaza Strip, now &quot;a grave yard for children&quot; according to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, a new and harrowing acronym has been born out of necessity by medical professionals &ndash; &#39;WCNSF&#39; (Wounded Child No Surviving Family). Such a term should not exist in a post-Holocaust world.</p>

<p>My days have recently been intensely devoted to sifting through the deluge of information and misinformation coming out of the situation in Palestine. I&#39;ve been absorbed by the constant news coverage, and what I&#39;m seeing can only be described as a genocidal massacre in Gaza, and a simultaneous ethnocide in the West Bank. The Western media and political establishment, seemingly in lockstep, have amplified the drums of war, echoing Israel&#39;s brutalities, fully financed and diplomatically shielded by U.S and European allies. The scale of devastation in Gaza since Israel&#39;s bombardments began last month is staggering, literally unimaginable.&nbsp;Hospitals, schools, refugee camps&mdash;no place is sacred nor life spared. The death toll stands at a haunting 11,000 and 30,000 wounded, the majority children, not sparing them from Netanyahu&#39;s dismissive branding as &quot;the children of darkness&quot; or from being coldly labelled &quot;collateral damage&quot; by U.S. officials. As if pulled straight from a supervillain scene, in the middle of this carnage, Netanyahu appears in a televised address, reciting a biblical verse: &quot;You must remember what the Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible&quot;, appealing to his legion of American Evangelicals, &quot;we remember. And we are fighting.&quot; The Bible verse in question: &quot;Now go and smite Amalek, utterly destroy all they have and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ax&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term &#39;unprecedented&#39; has been oft-repeated yet aptly fits the current onslaught which has gone above and beyond Israel&#39;s usual policy towards Gaza of periodical bombardments, what it calls &quot;mowing the lawn&quot; and &quot;taking out the trash&quot;. This time the situation escalated alarmingly. Hamas fighters, breaching the 16-year-long siege, has struck back, killing 1200 Israelis, some of whom include Israeli activists involved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace movement, and capturing some 240 civilians on October the 7th. Hamas has stated its intention to negotiate an exchange deal, highlighting the plight of thousands of Palestinians held in administrative detention indefinitely and without trial, subjected to military court proceedings based on their ethnicity.&nbsp;In turn, the Israeli president, in a harrowing live broadcast, casted collective blame on the entire Palestinian population for Hamas&#39; actions, saying &quot;It&#39;s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It&#39;s not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved&quot;.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Israeli Minister of Culture Otzma Yehudit&nbsp;proposed that &quot;nuking Gaza is an option&quot; and to &quot;blow up and flatten everything&quot;.&nbsp;At any rate, it is clear that millions of Palestinians will be permanently dispossessed again, in what commentators, including Israeli officials, have called the second Nakba. There will eventually be peace, perhaps in months or years time, but justice will be harder to obtain. Pity the Palestinians for speaking out against occupation and war crimes.</p>

<p>Outside of Israel, where the hundreds of thousands across the world who had the gall to protest a ceasefire have been labelled by the UK Home Secretary as &ldquo;hate marches&rdquo; and framed as anti-semitic terrorist sympathisers by much of the Western media. A rabid McCarthyite backlash has been unleashed on any criticism of Israel, mainly perpetuated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent pro-Israel lobby group in the U.S and the biggest donor to the Democrats 2020 election campaign. The House of Representatives, most of whom accepted money from the AIPAC during the 2022 election, voted to censure one of its own, the only Palestian member in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), over &quot;promoting false narratives&quot; about the Israeli war on Gaza. Meanwhile, anti-Zionist student groups like Jewish Voices for Peace are being suspended from U.S. campuses and journalists from the BBC, APC, NYT and other lesser known outlets were recently sacked over Palestinian&nbsp;support. Wall street firms have already published lists of names of students they deem &#39;unemployable&#39; due to their stance on Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel continues to act with impunity and its offensive show no&nbsp;signs of abating, with the UN Security Council&#39;s impotence ensuring continuous U.S. veto support for Israel and no ceasefire. Yet, when put to democratic vote in the General Assembly, the GA did adopt a resolution with an overwhelming majority vote from most States calling for an immediate ceasfire and an end to the collective punishment of Gazans via Israel&#39;s blockade of fuel, water, medical aid and electricity. The U.S, of course, voted against, while Israel called the resolution&#39;despicable&#39; and a day of &#39;infamy&#39;. At least the former UN permanent representative was more honest, saying &quot;I&#39;m very puzzled about the constant concern which the world is showing for the Palestinian people, for these horrible inhuman animals who have done the worst atrocities that this century has seen&quot;. Essentially, no mainstream media outlet in the U.S. even bothered to cover the resolution; not a single one. It was the wrong story to publish. Meanwhile, when the U.N. had a vote denouncing the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the U.S.</p>

<p>Instead, the narrative constructed by Western media and political figures systematically begins&nbsp;on October the 7th. This selective chronology that obscures history and human complexity, has fashioned a dangerously orientalist trope: the acts of desperate aggression from Hamas is amplified as inherent to the Palestinian character that is naturally inclined to terroristic acts without any antecedent context, such that when Palestinians who have had family members killed by Israeli bombardment are interviewed, they are invariably asked to denounce and condemn Hamas, as if one is assimilated into the other by default and thus declared guilty until proven otherwise.&nbsp;We are told that Israel has a &#39;right to defend itself&#39; in killing 11,000 Palestinian civilians so long as a handful of militants are killed, too. This insidious logic, echoed unquestioningly in the media, effectively renders these lives as expendable, their deaths mere footnotes instrumental to the occupying force&#39;s ends. The language of news headlines is telling: Palestinians merely &#39;die&#39; whereas Israelis are &#39;killed&#39;, Palestinian deaths are mere statistics whereas Israeli deaths are personalised.</p>

<p>We are then told by the same media and officials, including the U.S. President, that Palestinian deaths tolls are &#39;not to be trusted&#39;, while simultaneously and uncritically accepting Israeli assertions, such as repeating baseless accusations that Hamas &#39;beheaded 40 babies&#39;, that hospitals in Gaza are Hamas HQs and that Palestinian&nbsp;journalists are Hamas operatives. Even when these figures are later validated agencies like the CIA, the discourse swiftly pivots to the &#39;risk of potential future radicalisation&#39; of Palestinians, rather than confronting their immediate and tragic massacre. In other words, the only risk of massacring Palestinians is the impact it might later have on Israelis.</p>

<p>We watch as pundits, experts and officials are repeatedly allowed to engage in anti-Palestinian hate speech totally unchallenged by journalists, as they dehumanise Palestinians&mdash;&ldquo;human animals&rdquo; as the Israeli defence minister put it&mdash;while presenting an unctuous narrative of Israeli victimhood that is disconnected from reality and undettered by history. Full of contradictions and flat-out lies, the overpaid legion of clueless and lost foreign reporters&mdash;unable to access Gaza&mdash;have taken to swallow the standard propaganda served up by the occupying force, in contrast to the detailed and raw pictures and videos seen directly by the eyes of Palelstinan journalists on the ground in Gaza that is distended to depict the extreme situation they find themselves in. Yet, the Palestinian reporters&mdash;the one&#39;s not yet killed&mdash;have today been dismissed as Hamas operatives, likely as a justification for the 40 reported journalists already killed according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.&nbsp;And when we speak to many audiences in the West, they shrug and appeal to exceptional complexity, as bombs continue to rain down on besieged Palestinians with unprecedented force. The disparity in media portrayal extends beyond news reporting. A skit on SNL trivialises Palestinian suffering where it serves as a punchline, in contrast to the solemn and respectful coverage when the Russian offensive in Ukraine began, with choir songs played over a candlelight vigil paying tribute to Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israeli society, meanwhile, seems to experience collective amnesia about the initial expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, the ongoing settlement expansion, the frequent closures, the expropriations, humiliations, collective punishments, and arbitrary difficulties. These realities are overshadowed by an extended layer of narrative&nbsp;where Israel&#39;s kind hearted generosity in permitting a drop of autonomy to the Palestinians in a besieged strip and an apartheid-ruled land with a puppet government should somehow make them grateful and indebted.&nbsp;On Twitter, the spokesperson for the Jewish Settlers of Hebron stated, &quot;The great Gaza giveaway, the disengagement, was the fruit of the two-state way of thinking. Gaza was evacuated of Jews, handed over to the PA, and soon taken over by Hamas, leading to the October 7th massacre.&quot;&nbsp;This sentiment was echoed by Israeli legal scholar Eugene Kontorovich, who opined, &quot;Imagine the consequences of statehood. There could have been 100 times more deaths.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this discourse, the autonomy afforded to Palestinians is perceived as the catalyst for Hamas&#39;s attacks, perpetuating the notion that any degree of self-governance granted is directly proportional to an increased likelihood of Palestinian aggression. Within this frame of thinking, the Palestinian is grotesquely caricatured as a figure barely restraining a primal urge to destroy, innately anti-Semitic, driven by a compulsion to kill for the mere thrill of it. This portrayal dehumanizes the Palestinian into a monstrous entity, an unpredictable, ferocious beast, whose only deterrence is the firm hand of those who &#39;understand&#39; his nature&mdash;a hand that must confine and chain, lest he unleashes his base, destructive instincts. Thus, to accord Palestinians the status of rational, benevolent beings is viewed, in this mindset, as a fundamental empirical mistake. Governance, therefore, must be exercised in a manner that forestalls any potential for Palestinian violence. It envisages an armor, a metaphoric straitjacket, restraining this so-perceived lunatic from executing his deep-seated, destructive desires. This paradigm, it seems, is the prevailing mode of thought for many in Israel today, a lens through which the Palestinian identity is not just viewed but also managed and controlled,</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is much more clear that military domination over Palestinians have failed to achieve security for Israelis. They are baffled that ruling with sieges and martial law&mdash;intermittent air raids, unending drone surveillance, invasive searches at discriminatory checkpoints at every corner, sniper fire at protests, and detention without trial&mdash;has bolstered military resistance among the young generations of those born into the legacy of the Nakba, who have grown weary of hollow diplomatic promises unkept for 75 years. Instead of acknowledging the long-standing and oppressive Israeli military occupation as a catalyst for October 7, there&#39;s a disturbing sentiment among many Israelis favoring a reoccupation of Gaza. This perspective alarmingly advocates for the expulsion of Palestinians to Sinai, treating them not as people with rights and histories but as mere nuisances to be disposed of, a problem to be shuffled, and a logistical inconvenience. Rather than individuals with distinct identities and histories, they are instead seen as interchangeable with the broader Arab population, easily uprooted and relocated en masse because after all, they are subsumed under a generic, essentialist &#39;Arab&#39; label, a swarm of annoying bees who cannot possibly have any qualms in migrating to the other hive where other bees of a similar breed are present.</p>

<p>I attended an American school here in Doha, where many of the students were children of the Palestinian diaspora. These were the progeny of the Nakba, whose ancestors were forcibly displaced from their homeland&mdash;a homeland to which, even now, Israel denies their return. Stateless, their parents had adopted various nationalities, including American, yet when asked where they&#39;re from, my classmates consistently identified themselves as Palestinian, even if nomads in a world governed by inflexible borders.&nbsp;This adherence to Palestinian identity, undiminished by the vicissitudes of statelessness, stood in stark contrast to their immersion in an educational ethos often championed as the hallmarks of a Western liberal tradition &mdash; democracy, civil liberties, the rule of law, and human rights.&nbsp;Yet, this education, with its promises of enlightenment and liberation, paradoxically illuminated the profound contradictions at its heart.&nbsp;We, as students straddling multiple worlds, became acutely aware of the discrepancies and selectivity embedded in these proclaimed universal ideals.&nbsp;Our education did not just impart knowledge; it sharpened our perception of the inherent contradictions within a global order still imbued with colonial legacies, even if it does not speak in the language of the Belgian Congo or the British Raj. In Palestine, this brand of settler colonialism is deafening to our ears.</p>

<p>What are we supposed to make of the glaring differential treatment and selective empathy where Palestinian lives are less grievable than other lives? I can&#39;t help but reflect whether my life,&nbsp;in counterfactual geopolitical circumstances, would suddenly become less valuable; would I too be similarly dehumanised and transform into an instrumental statistic or an interchangeable Arab? By virtue of this line of questioning, and the links I draw between myself and my&nbsp;Palestinian classmates, under what conditions am I to claim otherwise? This is the colonial legacy at stake which upholds a principle of uneuqal vulnerability; the systemic and intentional creation of conditions where racialised and colonised groups are made more vulnerable to violence, oppression, and disregard, and their lives are systematically cheapened in favour of the colonisers&#39; interests.&nbsp;This extends beyond physical vulnerability to include narrative vulnerability where the stories, experiences, and histories of the colonised are more easily dismissed, manipulated, or ignored.</p>

<p>Biden, in a rare Oval Office address, announced a plan to allocate $14 billion to Israel as part of the &#39;war effort&#39;, signaling what he termed an &#39;inflection point in U.S. history&#39;. I speak for many Arabs who have witnessed the one two many&nbsp;when I say that this has been our own &quot;inflection point&quot;, too. The struggle for Palestinian self-determination will persist beyond this genocidal conflict, just as it has endured since the first Nakba and throughout 75 years of continued occupation. The dispossession and uprooting of a people, the demolition of their homes, and subjugation under military rule cannot be expected to be passively accepted. There needs to be a vision beyond Zionism, one that aligns with what Edward Said termed &#39;peace with justice&#39;. This vision must begin by acknowledging the current suffering of the Palestinians and the historic injustices upon which Israel was established. Palestinians bear a deep-seated resentment and anger stemming from these unaddressed past wrongs that are only aggravated by their ongoing nature.&nbsp;If reconciliation is genuinely sought&mdash;a prospect that current actions do not seem to support&mdash;it necessitates grappling with these uncomfortable truths. Though a shockingly large number of the Western public have uncrititcally bathed in Israeli propaganda, an unprecedented dose of empathy for Palestinian liberation has been injected by dissenting voices, many of them Jewish.&nbsp;Even within Israeli society, there are extremely faint but hopeful movements. Brave activists, in the face of police intimidation and public hostility, are making their carefully hedged voices heard. In small but significant gatherings, they stand with signs opposing the war, offering a flicker of light in an otherwise relentless darkness.</p>
