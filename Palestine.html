<h1>Wounded Child No Survivng Family</h1>

<p>This week in the Gaza Strip, now &quot;a grave yard for children&quot; according to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, a new and harrowing acronym has been born out of necessity by medical professionals &ndash; &#39;WCNSF&#39; (Wounded Child No Surviving Family). Such a term should not exist in a post-Holocaust world.</p>

<p>My days have recently been intensely devoted to sifting through the deluge of information and misinformation coming out of the situation in Palestine. I&#39;ve been absorbed by the constant news coverage, and what I&#39;m seeing can only be described as a genocidal massacre in Gaza, and a simultaneous ethnocide in the West Bank. The Western media and political establishment, seemingly in lockstep, have amplified the drums of war, echoing Israel&#39;s brutalities, fully financed and diplomatically shielded by U.S and European allies. The scale of devastation in Gaza since Israel&#39;s bombardments began last month is staggering, literally difficult to comprehend.&nbsp;Hospitals, schools, refugee camps&mdash;no place is sacred, no life spared. The death toll stands at a haunting 11,000 and 30,000 wounded, the majority children, not sparing them from Netanyahu&#39;s dismissive branding as &quot;the children of darkness&quot; or from being coldly labelled &quot;collateral damage&quot; by U.S. officials. As if pulled straight from a supervillain scene, in the middle of this carnage, Netanyahu appears in a televised address, reciting a biblical verse: &quot;You must remember what the Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible&quot;, probably appealing to his legion of American Evangelicals, &quot;we remember. And we are fighting.&quot; The Bible verse in question is this; &quot;Now go and smite Amalek, utterly destroy all they have and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ax&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term &#39;unprecedented&#39; has been oft-repeated yet aptly fits the current onslaught which has gone above and beyond Israel&#39;s usual policy towards Gaza of periodical bombardments, which it calls &quot;mowing the lawn&quot; and &quot;taking out the trash&quot;. This time the situation escalated alarmingly. Hamas fighters, breaching the 16-year-long siege, has struck back, causing 1200 Israeli deaths and capturing some 240 on October the 7th. Hamas has stated its intention to negotiate an exchange deal, highlighting the plight of thousands of Palestinians held in administrative detention indefinitely and without trial, subjected to military court proceedings based on their ethnicity.&nbsp;In turn, the Israeli president, in a harrowing live broadcast, casted collective blame on the entire Palestinian population for Hamas&#39; actions, erasing the line between combatant and civilian.</p>

<p>The hundreds of thousands across the world who had the gall to protest a ceasefire have been labelled by the UK Home Secretary as &ldquo;hate marches&rdquo; and framed as anti-semitic terrorist sympathisers by much of the Western media. A rabid McCarthyite backlash has been unleashed on any criticism of Israel, mainly perpetuated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent pro-Israel lobby group in the U.S and the biggest donor to the Democrats 2020 election campaign. The House of Representatives, most of whom accepted money from the AIPAC during the 2022 election, voted to censure one of its own, the only Palestian member in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), over &quot;promoting false narratives&quot; about the Israeli war on Gaza. Meanwhile, anti-Zionist student groups like Jewish Voices for Peace are being suspended from U.S. campuses and journalists from the BBC, APC, NYT and other lesser known outlets were recently sacked over Palestinian&nbsp;support. Wall street firms have already published lists of names of students they deem &#39;unemployable&#39; due to their stance on Israel. Meanwhile, the Israeli Minister of Culture Otzma Yehudit&nbsp;proposed that &quot;nuking Gaza is an option&quot; and to &quot;blow up and flatten everything&quot;. At any rate, it is clear that millions of Palestinians will be permanently dispossessed again, in what commentators, including Israeli officials, have called the second Nakba. There will eventually be peace, perhaps in months or years time, but justice will be harder to obtain. Pity the Palestinians for speaking out against occupation and war crimes.</p>

<p>It was hoped that, following the World Wars, the establishment of the U.N. to oversee international law, the world would not have to bear witness to another human atrocity. This month evidences that the rule of the jungle, &#39;might makes right&#39;, supersedes on the rule of law in the international world, as Israel continues to act with impunity and its offensive show no&nbsp;signs of abating, with the UN Security Council&#39;s impotence ensuring continuous U.S. veto support for Israel and no ceasefire, just as it had vetoed resolutions sanctioning apartheid South Africa in the 70s and 80s. Yet, when put to democratic vote in the General Assembly, the GA did adopt a resolution with an overwhelming majority vote from most States calling for an immediate ceasfire and an end to the collective punishment of Gazans via Israel&#39;s blockage of fuel, water, medical aid and electricity. The U.S, of course, voted against, while Israel called it &#39;despicable&#39; and a day of &#39;infamy&#39;. At least the former UN permanent representative was more honest, saying &quot;I&#39;m very puzzled about the constant concern which the world is showing for the Palestinian people, for these horrible inhuman animals who have done the worst atrocities that this century has seen&quot;. Essentially, no mainstream media outlet in the U.S. even bothered to cover the resolution; not a single one. It was the wrong story to publish. Meanwhile, when the U.N. had a vote denouncing the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the U.S.</p>

<p>The narrative constructed by Western media and political figures systematically begins&nbsp;on October the 7th. This selective chronology that obscures history and human complexity, has fashioned a dangerously orientalist trope: the acts of desperate aggression from Hamas is amplified as inherent to the Palestinian character that is naturally inclined to terroristic acts without any antecedent context, such that when Palestinians who have had family members killed&nbsp;are interviewed on Western media, they are invariably asked to denounce and condemn Hamas, as if one is assimilated into the other by default.&nbsp;Israeli society, meanwhile, seems to experience collective amnesia about the initial expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, the ongoing settlement expansion, the frequent closures, the expropriations, humiliations, collective punishments, and arbitrary difficulties. These realities are overshadowed by an extended layer of narrative&nbsp;where Israel&#39;s kind hearted generosity in permitting a drop of autonomy to the Palestinians in a besieged strip and an apartheid-ruled land should somehow make them grateful and indebted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is clear that military domination over Palestinians have failed to achieve security for Israelis. They are baffled that ruling with sieges and martial law&mdash;intermittent air raids, unending drone surveillance, invasive searches at discriminatory checkpoints at every corner, sniper fire at protests, and detention without trial&mdash;has bolstered military resistance among the young generations of those born into the legacy of the Nakba, who have grown weary of hollow diplomatic promises unkept for 75 years. Instead of acknowledging the long-standing and oppressive Israeli military occupation as a catalyst for October 7, there&#39;s a disturbing sentiment among many Israelis favoring a reoccupation of Gaza, an increase in military oppression. This perspective alarmingly advocates for the expulsion of Palestinians to Sinai, treating them not as people with rights and histories but as mere nuisances to be disposed of, a problem to be shuffled, and a logistical inconvenience. Rather than individuals with distinct identities and histories, they are instead seen as interchangeable with the broader Arab population, easily uprooted and relocated en masse because after all, they are subsumed under a generic, essentialist &#39;Arab&#39; label, a swarm of annoying bees who cannot possibly have any qualms in migrating to the other hive where other bees of a similar breed are present.</p>

<p>We are told that Israel has a &#39;right to defend itself&#39; in killing 11,000 Palestinian civilians so long as a handful of militants are killed, too. This insidious logic, echoed unquestioningly in the media, effectively renders these lives as expendable, their deaths mere footnotes instrumental to the occupying force&#39;s necessary ends. The language of news headlines is telling: Palestinians merely &#39;die&#39; whereas Israelis are &#39;killed&#39;, Palestinian deaths are mere statistics whereas Israeli deaths are personalised. We are then told by Western media and officials, including the U.S. President, that these numbers are &#39;not to be trusted&#39;, while simultaneously accepting Israeli assertions without scrutiny, such as repeating baseless accusations that Hamas &#39;beheaded 40 babies&#39;, that hospitals in Gaza are Hamas HQs and that Palestinian&nbsp;journalists are Hamas HQs. Even when these figures are later validated by their own agencies like the CIA, the discourse swiftly pivots to the &#39;risk of potential future radicalisation&#39; of Palestinians, rather than confronting their immediate and tragic massacre. In other words, the only risk of massacring Palestinians is the impact it might later have on Israelis. We watch as pundits, experts and officials are repeatedly allowed to engage in anti-Palestinian hate speech totally unchallenged by journalists, as they dehumanise Palestinians&mdash;&ldquo;human animals&rdquo; as the Israeli defence minister put it&mdash;while presenting an unctuous narrative of Israeli victimhood that is disconnected from context and undettered by history. Full of contradictions and flat-out lies, the overpaid legion of clueless and lost foreign reporters&mdash;unable to access Gaza&mdash;have taken to swallow the standard propaganda served up by the occupying force, in contrast to the detailed and raw pictures and videos seen directly by the eyes of Palelstinan journalists on the ground in Gaza that is distended to depict the extreme situation they find themselves in. Yet, the Palestinian reporters&mdash;the one&#39;s not yet killed&mdash;have today been dismissed as Hamas operatives, likely as a justification for the 40 reported journalists already killed according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.&nbsp;And when we speak to many audiences in the West, they shrug and appeal to exceptional complexity, as bombs continue to rain down on besieged Palestinians with unprecedented force. The disparity in media portrayal extends beyond news reporting. A skit on SNL trivialises Palestinian suffering where it served as a punchline, in contrast solemn and respectful coverage when the Russian offensive in Ukraine began, with choir songs over a candlelight vigil paying tribute to Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I attended an American school here in Doha, where many of the students were children of the Palestinian diaspora. Being descendants of the Nakba refugees where 800,000 Palestinians were expulsed, they are still banned by Israel to return to their homeland. Stateless, their parents had adopted various nationalities, including American, yet when asked where they&#39;re from, my classmates consistently identified themselves as Palestinian, even if nomads in a world governed by inflexible borders.&nbsp;They were shaped by Western educational ideals - notions of democracy, civil liberties, the rule of law, and human rights. This paradox is not lost on us, the Arab youth educated by the West yet disenchanted by it. We have been honed to see the double standards, the selective blindness, and the manipulation of narratives.&nbsp;The fa&ccedil;ade has completely crumbled now, revealing a vicious, racist, and bloodthirsty colonial mindset which has not yet been thrown in the dustbin of history where it belongs, even if it does not speak in the language of the Belgian Congo or the British Raj in India. In Palestine, this brand of settler colonialism is deafening to our ears.</p>

<p>What are we supposed to make of the glaring differential treatment and selective empathy where Palestinian lives are less grievable than other lives? I can&#39;t help but reflect whether, in counterfactual geopolitical circumstances, my life would become less valuable; would I too be similarly dehumanised and transform into a statistic or an interchangeable Arab to be expulsed? By virtue of this line of questioning, and the links I am able to draw between myself and my&nbsp;Palestinian classmates, under what conditions am I to claim otherwise? This is the colonial attitude at stake which upholds a principle of uneuqal vulnerability; the systemic and intentional creation of conditions where racialised and colonised groups are made more vulnerable to violence, oppression, and disregard, and their lives are systematically cheapened in favour of the colonisers&#39; interests.&nbsp;This extends beyond physical vulnerability to include narrative vulnerability where the stories, experiences, and histories of the colonised are more easily dismissed, manipulated, or ignored.</p>

<p>Though much of the Western public have blantantly echoed this mentality, an unprecedented dose of empathy for the Palestianian cause has been injected by dissenting voices. This has been an &quot;inflection point&quot;, in Biden&#39;s words, for me and many other Arabs who have witnessed the one two many. The Palestinian right to self-determination will not stop after this genocidal war, just as it had not stopped after the first Nakba and the series of oppression that continues through 75 year of occupation. You cannot dispossess and uproot a people, demolish their homes and dominate over them with military rule, and expect them to simply take it. There must be an alternative vision than Zionism for peace that is not detached from justice. It perhaps starts with the premise that all lives are grievable.</p>
