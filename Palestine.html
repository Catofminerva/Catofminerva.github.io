<p>Wounded Child No Survivng Family (WCNSF) is a newly coined medical acronym unique to the Gaza Strip, used to identify children without so much as survivng distant relatives.</p>

<p>My days have recently been intensely devoted to sifting through the deluge of information and misinformation coming out of the situation in Palestine. I&#39;ve been absorbed by the constant news coverage, and what I&#39;m seeing is nothing short of a genocide in Gaza and an ethnocide in the West Bank. The West seems to be beating the drums of war to Israel&rsquo;s atrocities, fully funded (with $50 billion more on the way) and diplomatically enabled by the U.S and green-lighted by its European allies. The carnage in Gaza is literally inconceivable - over 10,000 lives extinguished after being starved, 20,000 wounded, 40% of them children -- since Israel&#39;s last month&#39;s bombardment began, targeting schools, hospitals, and refugee camps indiscriminately. This came after Hamas fighters broke the 16-year siege that Israel has imposed on Gaza and killed 1200 Israelis. The thousands who the gall to protest a ceasefire (in what the UK Home Secretary called &ldquo;hate marches&rdquo;) have been labelled anti-semitic terrorist sympathisers.</p>

<p>In my attempt to understand this, I&#39;ve been reflecting on historical uprisings against oppression, from the Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint L&#39;Ouverture to the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa by the likes of Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko who fought against a regime strikingly similar in its racist ideology and tactics to those employed by Israel in Palestine. The Israeli offensive in Gaza shows no signs of abating, with no cease-fire in sight, with the UN Security Council&#39;s impotence ensuring continuous U.S. support for Israel. I was about to comment that the mounting state-sanctioned settler violence and oppression in the West Bank hasn&#39;t ceased either, but then I realised that military occupation, land-grabs, arbitrary arrests, torture has been a constant for 75 years. At any rate, it is clear that millions of Palestinians will be permanently dispossessed again, in what commentators have called the second</p>

<p>As someone who received a Western education and grew up with Palestinian refugee friends who are still unable to return to their homeland, I find myself deeply disillusioned with the &quot;West.&quot; The fa&ccedil;ade has completely crumbled, revealing what I see as a vicious, racist, and bloodthirsty colonial mindset. It saddens me that colonialism has not yet been thrown in the dustbin of history where it belongs, even if it does not speak in the language of the Belgian Congo under Leopold II or the British Raj in India. In Palestine, this brand of settler colonialism is blatantly evident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mostly, I am shocked and appalled by the media&#39;s Orwellian portrayal of the genocide, which continues to dehumanise all Palestinians as fundamentalist villains &mdash; &ldquo;human animals&rdquo; as the Israeli defence minister put it &mdash; while presenting an unctuous narrative of Israeli victimhood that is disconnected from context and unfettered by history and human complexity. Full of contradictions and flat-out lies, the overpaid legion of clueless and lost foreign reporters&mdash;barred entry from Gaza by the IDF&mdash;have taken to swallow the standard propaganda served up by the occupying force, in contrast to the detailed and raw pictures and videos seen directly by the eyes of Palelstinan journalists on the ground in Gaza that is distended to depict the extreme situation they find themselves in. Future media students will likely study this as a prime example of propaganda. The latter have today been dismissed as Hamas operatives, likely as a justification for the 40 reported journalists already killed according to the CPJ. It&#39;s equally deeply disturbing to observe the genocidal rhetoric from the ordinary Western public which blatantly echoes this mentality. This has been an 'inflection point' for me and many other Arabs who have witnessed the one two many. The Palestinian right to self-determination will not stop after this genocidal war, just it had not stopped after the first Nakba and the series of wars and crimes continued through 75 year of occupation.</p>
