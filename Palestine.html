<h1>Wounded Child No Survivng Family</h1>

<p>This week in the Gaza Strip, now &quot;a grave yard for children&quot; according to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, a new and harrowing acronym has been born out of necessity by medical professionals &ndash; &#39;WCNSF&#39; (Wounded Child No Surviving Family). Such a term should not exist in a post-Holocaust world.</p>

<p>My days have recently been intensely devoted to sifting through the deluge of information and misinformation coming out of the situation in Palestine. I&#39;ve been absorbed by the constant news coverage, and what I&#39;m seeing is nothing short of a genocidal massacre in Gaza and an ethnocide in the West Bank. The West seems to be beating the drums of war to Israel&rsquo;s atrocities, fully funded and diplomatically enabled by the U.S and its European allies. The carnage in Gaza is literally inconceivable since Israel&#39;s last month&#39;s bombardments began, targeting schools, hospitals, and refugee camps indiscriminately. Thus far, over 11,000 lives has been extinguished after being starved, and 30,000 wounded, most of whom are children or what Netanyahu called &quot;the children of darkness&quot; and what U.S. officials referred to as &quot;collateral damage&quot;. Closed up to the camera he appears, addressing the nation: &quot;You must remember what the Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible&quot;, probably appealing to his legion of American Evangelicals, &quot;we remember. And we are fighting.&quot; The Bible verse in question is this; &quot;Now go and smite Amalek, utterly destroy all they have and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ax&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Probably the most neutral and overused word that has been employed to describe this conflict is &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Unprecedented so it is, Israel&#39;s offensive vastly overtakes the usual Israel policy towards Gaza, which it calls &quot;mowing the lawn&quot; and &quot;taking out the trash&quot;, where it periodically bombards it to weaken Hamas capabilities. This time, however, Hamas fighters broke the 16-year siege that Israel has imposed on Gaza and killed 1200 Israelis and captured 200 as hostages on October the 7th. Hamas says that they seek an exchange deal, where thousands of Palestinians are held in administrative detention indefinitely and without trial, and who would otherwise be trialed in a military court in virtue of their ethnicity. Israel&#39;s president has placed blame on the entire Palestinian population for the Hamas attack, saying on live television that &quot;It&#39;s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric that civilians were not aware, not involved, its absolutely not true&quot;, in other words, civilians are fair game. It is clear that military domination over Palestinians have failed to achieve security for Israelis. They are baffled that ruling with sieges and martial law&mdash;intermittent air raids, unending drone surveillance, invasive searches at discriminatory checkpoints at every corner, sniper fire at protests, and detention without trial&mdash;has bolstered military resistance among the young generations of those born into the legacy of the Nakba, who have grown weary of hollow diplomatic promises unkept for 75 years.</p>

<p>The hundreds of thousands across the world who had the gall to protest a ceasefire (in what the UK Home Secretary called &ldquo;hate marches&rdquo;) have been labelled anti-semitic terrorist sympathisers by much of the Western media. A rabid McCarthyite backlash has been unleashed on any criticism of Israel, mainly perpetuated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent pro-Israel lobby group in the U.S and the biggest donor to the Democrats 2020 election campaign. The House of Representatives, most of whom accepted money from the AIPAC during the 2022 election, voted to censure one of its own, the only Palestian member in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), over &quot;promoting false narratives&quot; about the Israeli war on Gaza. Meanwhile, anti-Zionist student groups like Jewish Voices for Peace are being suspended from U.S. campuses and journalists from the BBC, APC, NYT and other lesser known outlets were recently sacked over Palestinian&nbsp;support. Wall street firms have already published lists of names of students they deem &#39;unemployable&#39; due to their stance on Israel. Meanwhile, the Israeli Minister of Culture Otzma Yehudit&nbsp;proposed that &quot;nuking Gaza is an option&quot; and to &quot;blow up and flatten everything&quot;. At any rate, it is clear that millions of Palestinians will be permanently dispossessed again, in what commentators, including Israeli officials, have called the second Nakba. There will eventually be peace, perhaps in months or years time, but justice will be harder to obtain. Pity the Palestinians for speaking out against occupation and war crimes.</p>

<p>It was hoped that, following the World Wars, the establishment of the U.N. to oversee international law, the world would not have to bear witness to another human atrocity. This month evidences that the rule of the jungle, &#39;might makes right&#39;, supersedes on the rule of law in the international world, as Israel continues to act with impunity and its offensive show no&nbsp;signs of abating, with the UN Security Council&#39;s impotence ensuring continuous U.S. veto support for Israel and no ceasefire, just as it had vetoed resolutions sanctioning apartheid South Africa in the 70s and 80s. Yet, when put to democratic vote in the General Assembly, the GA did adopt a resolution with an overwhelming majority vote from most States calling for an immediate ceasfire and an end to the collective punishment of Gazans via Israel&#39;s blockage of fuel, water, medical aid and electricity. The U.S, of course, voted against, while Israel called it &#39;despicable&#39; and a day of &#39;infamy&#39;. At least the former UN permanent representative was more honest, saying &quot;I&#39;m very puzzled about the constant concern which the world is showing for the Palestinian people, for these horrible inhuman animals who have done the worst atrocities that this century has seen&quot;. Essentially, no mainstream media outlet in the U.S. even bothered to cover the resolution; not a single one. It was the wrong story to publish. Meanwhile, when the U.N. had a vote denouncing the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the U.S.</p>

<p>I attended an American school here in Doha, where many of the students were children of the Palestinian diaspora. Being descendants of the Nakba refugees where 800,000 Palestinians were expulsed, they are still banned by Israel to return to their homeland. Stateless, their parents had adopted various nationalities, including American, yet when asked where they&#39;re from, my classmates consistently identified themselves as Palestinian, even if nomads in a world governed by inflexible borders.&nbsp;They were shaped by Western educational ideals - notions of democracy, freedom, equality and human rights. This paradox is not lost on us, the Arab youth educated by the West yet disenchanted by it. We have been honed to see the double standards, the selective blindness, and the manipulation of narratives.&nbsp;The fa&ccedil;ade has completely crumbled now, revealing a vicious, racist, and bloodthirsty colonial mindset which has not yet been thrown in the dustbin of history where it belongs, even if it does not speak in the language of the Belgian Congo or the British Raj in India. In Palestine, this brand of settler colonialism is deafening to our ears.</p>

<p>The reality is framed by the epistemic authorities, namely the Western media and officials, such that all histroy and context starts on October the 7th. As such, the justificatory logic of the subsequent Gaza massacre became a generlaising orientalist trope that the Hamas attack is proof of the natural terroristic inclination of Palestinians and not the contemptible violent outburst of a few. A collective delusion looms over Israeli society that chooses to deny the dispossession and uprootedness in 1948 and ignore&nbsp;the unceasing rate of settlement activity, the frequent closures, the expropriations, the thousands of humiliations, punishments, and arbitrary difficulties created for Palestinians by Israelis while the two were supposed to be negotiating a peace with each other were all negligible, as if Israel&rsquo;s magnanimity in &ldquo;allowing&rdquo; little bits of Palestinian autonomy were enough to wipe the slate clean and should have made the entire people grateful to Israel for its concessions. Rather than trying to connect the Israeli policy of military occupation with October 7, as cause and effect, many Israelis now seem to want Israel to re-occupy Gaza and the &#39;Arabs and go to Sinai&#39;, as if &lsquo;the Arabs&rsquo; were so many flies or a swarm of annoying bees who can simply relocate to the other hive where those other bees of the same breed are located.</p>
