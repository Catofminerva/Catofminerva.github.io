<h1>Wounded Child No Survivng Family</h1>

<p>This week in the Gaza Strip, now called &quot;a grave yard for children&quot; by U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, a new and harrowing acronym has been born out of necessity by medical professionals &ndash; &#39;WCNSF&#39; (Wounded Child No Surviving Family). Such a term should not exist in a post-Holocaust world.</p>

<p>My days have recently been intensely devoted to sifting through the deluge of information and misinformation coming out of the situation in Palestine. I&#39;ve been absorbed by the constant news coverage, and what I&#39;m seeing is nothing short of a genocidal massacre in Gaza and an ethnocide in the West Bank. The West seems to be beating the drums of war to Israel&rsquo;s atrocities, fully funded and diplomatically enabled by the U.S and its European allies. The carnage in Gaza is literally inconceivable since Israel&#39;s last month&#39;s bombardment began, targeting schools, hospitals, and refugee camps indiscriminately. Over 11,000 lives extinguished after being starved and 30,000 wounded, most of them children or what the U.S. official call &quot;collateral damage&quot;. This vastly overtakes the usual Israel policy towards Gaza which it calls &quot;mowing the lawn&quot; and &quot;taking out the trash&quot;, which entails periodic bombardments to weaken Hamas capabilities. The onslaught came after Hamas fighters broke the 16-year siege that Israel has imposed on Gaza and killed 1200 Israelis and captured 200 as hostages, in the hopes of an exchange deal where thousands of Palestinians are held in administrative detention indefinitely and without trial, and who would otherwise be trialed in a military court in virtue of their ethnicity. In reaction to the violence, the hundreds of thousands who had the gall to protest a ceasefire (in what the UK Home Secretary called &ldquo;hate marches&rdquo;) have been labelled anti-semitic terrorist sympathisers by much of the Western media. A rabid McCarthyite backlash has been unleashed on any criticism of Israel, mainly perpetuated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most prominent pro-Israel lobby group in the U.S and the biggest donor to the Democrats 2020 election campaign. The House of Representatives, most of whom accepted money from the AIPAC during the 2022 election, voted to censure one of its own, the only Palestian member in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), over &quot;promoting false narratives&quot; about the Israeli war on Gaza. Meanwhile, anti-Zionist student groups like Jewish Voices for Peace are being suspended from U.S. campuses and journalists from the BBC, APC, NYT and other lesser known outlets were recently sacked over Palestinian&nbsp;support. Wall street firms have already published lists of names of students they deem &#39;unemployable&#39; due to their stance on Israel. Pity the Palestinians for speaking out against occupation and war crimes.</p>

<p>It was hoped that, following the World Wars, the establishment of the U.N. to oversee international law, the world would not have to bear witness to another human atrocity. This month evidences that the rule of the jungle, &#39;might makes right&#39;, supersedes on the rule of law in the international world, as Israel continues to act with impunity and its offensive show no&nbsp;signs of abating, with the UN Security Council&#39;s impotence ensuring continuous U.S. veto support for Israel and no ceasefire, just as it had vetoed resolutions sanctioning apartheid South Africa in the 70s and 80s. Yet, when put to democratic vote in the General Assembly, the GA did adopt a resolution with an overwhelming majority vote from most States calling for an immediate ceasfire and an end to the collective punishment of Gazans via Israel&#39;s blockad of human essentials and aid. The U.S., of course, voted against, while Israel called it &#39;despicable&#39; and a day of &#39;infamy&#39;. Essentially, no mainstream media outlet in the U.S. even bothered to cover the resolution; not a single one. It was the wrong story to publish. Meanwhile, when the U.N. had a vote denouncing the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the U.S.</p>

<p>I was about to comment that the mounting state-sanctioned settler violence and oppression in the West Bank hasn&#39;t ceased either, but then I realised that military occupation, land-grabs, arbitrary arrests and torture has been a constant for 75 years and the U.N. has been equally impotent to act. At any rate, it is clear that millions of Palestinians will be permanently dispossessed again, in what commentators have called the second Nakba.</p>

<p>I attended an American school here in Doha, where many of the students were children of the Palestinian diaspora. Being descendants of the Nakba refugees, they are still barred by Israel to return to their homeland. Stateless, their parents had adopted various nationalities, including American, yet when asked about their nationality, my classmates consistently identified themselves as Palestinian, even if nomads in a world governed by inflexible borders.&nbsp;They were shaped by Western educational ideals - notions of democracy, freedom, and human rights. This paradox is not lost on us, the Arab youth educated by the West yet disenchanted by it. We have been honed to see the double standards, the selective blindness, and the manipulation of narratives.&nbsp;The fa&ccedil;ade has completely crumbled now, revealing a vicious, racist, and bloodthirsty colonial mindset which has not yet been thrown in the dustbin of history where it belongs, even if it does not speak in the language of the Belgian Congo or the British Raj in India. In Palestine, this brand of settler colonialism is deafening to our ears.</p>

<p>Mostly, I am shocked and appalled by the media&#39;s Orwellian portrayal of the massacre, continously repeated by the standing U.S. President, which continues to dehumanise Palestinians as fundamentalist villains and barbarians&mdash;&ldquo;human animals&rdquo; as the Israeli defence minister put it&mdash;while presenting an unctuous narrative of Israeli victimhood that is disconnected from context and undettered by history and human complexity. Full of contradictions and flat-out lies, the overpaid legion of clueless and lost foreign reporters&mdash;unable to access Gaza&mdash;have taken to swallow the standard propaganda served up by the occupying force, in contrast to the detailed and raw pictures and videos seen directly by the eyes of Palelstinan journalists on the ground in Gaza that is distended to depict the extreme situation they find themselves in. Future media students will likely study this brazen breach of journalism standards in the Western media as a prime example of how deceptive language manufactures consent for acts of war crimes. Yet, the Palestinian reporters&mdash;the one&#39;s not yet killed&mdash;have today been dismissed as Hamas operatives, likely as a justification for the 40 reported journalists already killed according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Though much of the Western public have blantantly echoed this mentality, an unprecedented dose of empathy for the Palestianian cause has been injected by dissenting voices from the Left, notably again, from the likes of Jewish Voices for Peace. This has been an &quot;inflection point&quot;, in Biden&#39;s words, for me and many other Arabs who have witnessed the one two many. The Palestinian right to self-determination will not stop after this genocidal war, just as it had not stopped after the first Nakba and the series of oppression that continues through 75 year of occupation. When national consciousness is born, not even all of the U.S. military apparatus is able to stop it.</p>
