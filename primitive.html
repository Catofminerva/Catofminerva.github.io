            <img style="aspect-ratio:768/600;" src="https://fee.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2019-04-09-at-82424-am-768x600.png" alt="International Trade Refutes Hobbes's Theory about the State of Nature" width="768" height="600">
        </figure>
        
<p>The ‘State of Nature,’ as popularised by that dour 17th-century anatomist of power Thomas Hobbes, is a hypothetical construct where we get to imagine what life was like before the state. For Hobbes, our pre-state ancestors were feral, fractious and forever teetering on the brink of mutual annihilation: their lives, in his unforgettable phrasing, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. But this is less a historical account of pre-political peoples than a rhetorical device Hobbes used to justify to the Prince the brute necessity of the Leviathan, that is the sovereign state, as the only bulwark against humanity’s self-devouring impulses. The man was essentially a door-to-door salesman for Princes selling a centralised authority during the anxieties of an age when the crumbling of feudal hierarchies left people grasping for new myths to suture the social order.  The Leviathan thus becomes a confession that authority, to sustain itself, must first invent the specter of its own impossibility.</p>  

<p>But of interest to me here, is the Hobbesian caricature of hunter-gatherers as inherently violent and inept, which to me, smacks of what Nietzsche might call <em>ressentiment</em>. I call this framing of hunter-gatherer life the Neolithic prejudice; a prejudice born out of the agricultural revolution, when the tillers of soil began to construct their identity in opposition to the wanderers beyond the fence. Identities are forged through their negation. They are constitutionally exclusionary; their ontological make-up depends on not being some other group, and boundaries are drawn in relation to one another through constructed categorical oppositions that are reified over time. More often than not, these distinctions are grounded on ecological and economical factors, hence the prejudice of sedentary vs nomadic, serf vs free Cossack, hill vs valley, coastal vs desert, and so on. Of course, these are stories we tell ourselves until they are hardened into fact through mere repetition.</p>  

<p>The identity of Agrarians thus became contingent on a Neolithic prejudice against hunter-gatherers, who are not simply peoples occupying a different ecological niche, but are also fundamentally different people, people who are less advanced, barbarians, savages, backwards, uncivilised, and so on. As agriculture began to dominate in response to population growth, the identity of Agrarians became more entrenched as ‘not hunter-gatherers’, and the narrative of 'civilisation' was built in opposition to ‘primitive’ and agricultural societies started to project their own values (such as permanence, productivity, and control over the land) as superior to the values of hunter-gatherer life (leisure, mobility and freedom). The forager’s mobility is now recast as rootlessness, their leisure as laziness and their adaptability as ignorance. The Neolithic farmer, sweating under the sun for most of the day, could only justify his toil by rendering the hunter-gatherer who neither cultivated fields nor built permanent settlements, as an unproductive and backward.</p>  

<p>That is not to deny that there are real, observable differences between foragers and agrarians in terms of subsistence routines, material cultures, rituals, and ways of life, and these difference are not social constructs. But the opint is that these differences do not, in themselves, provide any meaningful grounds for making decisions about what to do. It is, in other words, the political significance and the social meanings that were and are attached to them which are socially constructed. This Neolithic prejudice, by creating markers between Agrarians and foragers, was a political project insofar as it fuelled justifications for the dispossession of the latter group and monopolized their resources, most illustratively when Europeans landed on the shores of the New World. Chief Justice John Marshall declared in 1823:</p>  

<p>“But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness...”</p>  

<p>And just like that, a linguistic vanishing act erases a millennia of reciprocal relations with the land and prepare the ground for their displacement. But to act as if hunter-gatherers were ignorant of farming is an anthropological mistake; they were often surrounded all around them by farming communities, but they actively refused to adopt their agriculture practices. To understand the bleak contingency of agrarian choices—and the sheer thinness of the Hobbesian narrative—one need only imagine a band of Pleistocene foragers, bemused by some proto-Hobbesian urging them to trade their leisurely foraging rounds for the backbreaking toil of sowing wheat. “Why,” they might ask, “should we chain ourselves to a plot of dirt, praying for rain and fretting over blight, when the forest offers figs and game without the hassle of tax collectors or warlords?” The answer, of course, is that they wouldn’t—and didn’t. To frame their refusal as some congenital failure to grasp the “obvious” virtues of surplus and sedentism is to mistake pragmatism for primitivism. One might as well chastise a bird for neglecting to build a dam. The forager’s calculus was simple: why work harder for less freedom, less health, and more hierarchy?</p>  

<p>That agrarian societies eventually proliferated says less about the inherent superiority of ploughs than about the demographic vise of population growth—a material constraint masquerading, in hindsight, as a moral triumph. That is, as populations grew, agriculture became more common, land more valuable, and labour less so. The idea of surplus production became the norm within Agrarian settlements to protect against annual variation in crop yield. No longer needing a nomadic lifestyle, these settlements expanded and began to tie the legitimacy of land use to its transformation into private property and productive output, where the development of property and surplus production became synonymous to economic 'progress', and societies that didn’t fit this logic were considered deficient.</p>  

<p>But the transition to agriculture was never a Hegelian march toward Reason or Lockeian covenant with Progress. It was a messy, reluctant adaptation that demanded new tools and new stories where collective labor is now individual duty, communal land is now private property, and shared abundance is now sinful indolence (though Calvin would later perfect this ideology and transmute toil into virtue and leisure into vice). The Neolithic workaround began as a way to feed more mouths on less land but hardened into a teleology that still embodies our economic imaginaries. A Neolithic hangover still, for example, equates “progress” with stockpiling surplus instead of sufficiency, still believes in infinite human wants, that production and consumption must be organised around the principle of scarcity, and assumes human flourishing to be reducible to yield-per-acre ratios.</p>  

<p>None of this is to deny the brute facts of demography or ecology. But facts, as Nietzsche also says, are stubborn only until we reinterpret them. When Chief Justice Marshall declared Indigenous lands “wilderness,” he wasn’t exactly parsing ecosystems; he was performing a speech act that turned reciprocal kinship with the land into a void awaiting colonial inscription. The forager’s “failure” to “improve” the soil—a failure that justified dispossession—was never about agronomy but about the power to define what counts as work, value, a shorthand for civilization.</p>  

<p>The tragedy is that we’re still hostage to these Neolithic binaries, still measuring human worth by bushels and balance sheets. Even our critiques of capitalism parrot the very metaphors they seek to dismantle and Marx’s “forces of production” owe more to agrarian metaphors than he’d care to admit.</p>  

<p>If we accept the Hobbesian story and its underlying Neolithic prejudice, then we are also accepting the hierarchies, control systems, and coercive structures of the state as unavoidable, even beneficial. But the entire narrative hinges on speculative philosophy about what we believe life was like before the agricultural revolution. Unfortunately, we do not have time machines to travel back 12,000 years ago and observe pre-contact hunter-gatherer societies as they were then.</p>  

<p>Other than recent archaeological data in paleopathology, barely any careful ethnological observations of pre-contact hunter-gatherers exist outside of the meandering, ethnocentric journals of 18th-century European explorers and missionaries. Contact has always been overwhelmingly destructive for these societies. But even so, the ethnological data of the few surviving contemporary hunter-gatherer groups paint an entirely different picture of our traditional understanding of hunter-gatherers.</p>

<!-- Content Paragraphs -->
<p>
<p>Our perception of early hunter gatherers societies really only began to change significantly during the mid-half of the 20th century after new research produced by various anthropologists and archaeologists, which the anthropologist Michael Sahlins had synthesised and published as evidence for what he called&nbsp;<i>The Original Affluent Society</i>, publishing an essay in that name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In it, he shows that hunter-gatherers were not locked in a desperate struggle for survival; their lives were in fact characterised by affluence. By "affluence," Sahlins refers to the satisfaction of desires, which may be "easily satisfied" either by producing much or desiring little. Because ‘affluence’, much like ‘happiness’, is an evaluative concept, it must be indexed to the frame of reference of those who experience it. Any attempt to universalise the concept of affluence—such as equating it solely with material abundance—inevitably smuggles in normative assumptions about which desires (which affective states individuals within a group experience) matter. This is precisely what early travellers did when they projected their bourgeois desires onto hunter-gatherer societies and framed them as deficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if the first necessary condition for judging whether a society is ‘affluent’ involves a contextual indexing or relativising to the agents involved, a second condition involves how the cultural practices of the society limit or inflate the clusters of desires which its members possess. With this in mind, we arrive at the following formulation of affluence:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>A society achieves affluence if and only if it can align its culturally defined desires with its available means.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Sahlins' topology, there are two models towards affluence:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Productive Affluence (the Galbraithean model):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Seeks wealth through ever greater material production to meet infinitely expansive desires.</li>
    <li>Economic progress is seen as the narrowing of the gap between limited means (resources) and unlimited wants. </li>
    <li>Industrial productivity theoretically makes ever more goods available to satisfy human wants.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zen Affluence (the hunter-gatherer model):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Rather than accumulate material goods, these societies are guided by other values: leisure, mobility and freedom.</li>
    <li>The number of material wants is inherently small and finite. </li>
    <li>The technical means of production remain relatively stable and are sufficiently adequate to meet desires. </li>
    <li>These desires are easily satisfied because cultural practices have acculturated people to desire less.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Hunter gatherers are actually far better nourished than most people in the modern world, and certainly, better that civilisations throughout human history (which fare much worse). Hunter gatherer calorie and nutrient consumption met or exceeded the standards of the National Research Council of America. For example, during a four-day observation at Hemple Bay, the mean daily calorie intake was 2,160 per person, while at Fish Creek, it was 2,130 calories over 11 days. The San Bushmen consumed around 2,140 calories per day, which exceeds their estimated requirement of 1,975 calories when adjusted for body weight, activity levels, and population demographics, and the Hadza consumed around 3000 per day. Malnutrition was rare in all cases. And the surplus is not wasted but often goes to dogs. Compare this with the urban poor in many undeveloped nations who consume around 1500 calories per day and where malnutrition is prevalent. A study by Cohen and Armelagos (1984) compared the height and health of pre-agricultural and agricultural populations. They found that pre-agricultural populations, such as the Late Upper Paleolithic European hunter-gatherers, were taller, had better teeth, an were more robust than their agricultural counterparts, and found little signs of disease in skeletal evidence compared to Agrarians.&nbsp;

    Food is abundant and easily accessed in hunter-gatherer societies. The Dobe !Kung Bushmen, despite harsh environmental conditions the year in which anthropologists had visited, where annual rainfall was as low as 6 to 10 inches, they still thrived in a region with abundant vegetation. The mangetti nut often rotted on the ground in surplus. A single individual’s efforts in hunting and gathering could support four to five people. In effect, Bushmen food production was more efficient than French farming prior to World War II, when over 20% of the population was engaged in feeding the rest.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    While the men hunted, the women of the southeastern Australian Aboriginals spend about six hours a day gathering, half of which involved "loitered away in the shade or by the fire". &nbsp;Aboriginals held a preference for making life "as easy as possible" because resources like game and water were readily available: “they can obtain, in two or three hours, a sufficient supply of food for the day”, yet their customary approach is to “roam indolently from spot to spot, lazily collecting it as they wander along”. Observers noted that food was so plentiful that some regions could have supported double the population without scarcity, and a few minutes of fishing could provide enough food for an entire tribe. During the Murray River’s annual inundation, for example, abundant freshwater crayfish sustained hundreds of people for weeks.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The Hadza people of Africa are just as relaxed in their efficiency. Among the last true hunter-gatherers, they live near Lake Eyasi where resources are plentiful and depend on wild game, honey, and foraged plants. Men often spend dry seasons gambling, even losing their metal-tipped arrows, leaving hunting to a minority, while women gather vegetables at a leisurely pace. Across the year, the average time spent acquiring food is under two hours daily, yet they consistently meet their nutritional needs.

<p>
    Hunter-gatherers had a remarkably relaxed approach to labour, working an average of just 2–5 hours a day to meet their subsistence needs. “Foragers,” Sahlins observed, “keep bankers’ hours". This is because their production was driven by immediate needs rather than an endless pursuit of surplus, resulting in a deliberately "erratic" work pattern.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    It's important to note that the conceptual separation of work-leisure was not a thing for them, emically speaking; the very concept of ‘work’, as we contemporaries understand it, is entirely alien to hunter-gatherers (think how some people go hunting and foraging for leisure today). People chattered, sang, ritualised and made art while ‘working’. And there was no boss to report to. Once food and resources were secured, ‘work’ ceased, and time was spent on ‘leisure’, rest, and social activities. This is a culturally instituted decision: the McArthur 1960 study of Australian hunter-gatherers notes that “The quantity of food gathered in one day by any of these groups could in every instance have been increased”, but there's no need for surplus to be appropriated by the boss.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Australian hunter-gatherer women often rested while gathering, and men took days off after successful hunts. "Perhaps they judge what they consider to be enough, and when that is collected they stop." Similarly, Arnhem Landers structured their lives to maximise leisure, with only 65% of the population engaged in food production, and even those spent just 36% of their time on labour. On average, this translated to about 2 hours and 9 minutes of work per day, leaving ample time for crafts, visiting, and relaxation. The Arnhem Landers even invested time in cultivating dietary diversity to avoid monotony and were not satisfied with "a bare existence. Anthropologists found the existence of individuals who were 'full-time craftsmen', but who other than their craft, occasionally exerted themselves in activities like netting fish or gathering bees' nests, but otherwise spent most of their time “talking, eating, and sleeping.”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The Dobe Bushmen demonstrated similar efficiency. Women often gathered enough food in a single day to last three, while men hunted intermittently, sometimes taking weeks off between efforts. Subsistence tasks like cooking or fetching water required just 1–3 hours, freeing up the rest of the day for rest, socialising, and dancing. In short, the economy prioritised sufficiency and quality of life over accumulation. For some hunter-gatherers who had been pushed into areas with extreme climates, they perform lots of work compacted together, followed by lots of rest.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Want Not Lack Not</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    We briefly touched on how hunter-gatherers' low standard of living is culturally and intentionally defined. Indeed, anthropologists found relatively few possessions with them, but they were content with this, in fact, this was a "matter of policy" and not a misfortune: "Want not, lack not" is their credo. It cannot be the case that this was because they were too busy with 'food quests', because anthropologists testify that foraging and hunting was "so successful that half the time the people seem not to know what to do with themselves." They also did not care so much for property, as nomadic movement greatly depreciated property value; the hunters' material wealth quickly becomes a burden. One striking account highlights this disposition:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    “We were humiliated by the realization of how little there was we could give to the Bush­ men. Almost everything seemed likely to make life more difficult for them by adding to the litter and weight of their daily round. They themselves had practically no possessions: a loin strap, a skin blanket and a leather satchel. There was nothing that they could not assemble in one minute, wrap up in their blankets and carry on their shoulders for a journey of a thousand miles. They had no sense of possession.&nbsp;”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Clearly, what was a necessity for these researchers was not so culturally instituted for hunter gatherers. This made them simply lack an interest in developing their technology—as a matter of choice. This is precisely how their are affluent (incidentally, if you have ever met a super-rich individual who has arrived via the Galbraithean road, you might notice similar behaviour of indifference to material possessions). As Sahlins notes, "They have the kind of nonchalance that would be appropriate to a people who have mastered the problems of production."
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Another anthropologist describes the !Kung's indifference to material possessions:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    “The European observer has the impression that these [YahganJ Indians place no value whatever on their utensils and that they have completely forgotten the effort it took to make them. Actually, no one clings to his few goods and chattels which, as it is, are often and easily lost, but just as easily replaced. . . . The Indian does not even exercise care when he could conveniently do so. A European is likely to shake his head at the boundless indifference of these people who drag brand-new objects, precious clothing, fresh provisions, and valuable items through thick mud, or abandon them to their swift destruction by children and dogs. . . . Expensive things that are given them are treasured for a few hours, out of curiousity; after that they thoughtlessly let everything deteriorate in the mud and wet. The less they own, the more comfortable they can travel, and what is ruined they occasionally replace. Hence, they are completely indif­ferent to any material possessions.”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Prodigality</strong></p>

<p>
    The economic behaviour of hunter-gatherers can be understood as a reaction to their context of abundance. The notion of ‘prodigality’, viz., the immediate consumption of available resources, is indicative of the psychological and cultural disposition that emerges from a society that operates without the constraints of market economies. Without the pressure of scarcity or surplus accumulation, the hunter-gatherers’ behaviour is one of satisfaction, totally unbothered by the cycles of production and consumption that dominate modern life.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The Hadza are a great case in point. They remain surrounded by cultivators in East Africa but have historically refused to adopt farming, citing "too much hard work" as their reason. Their attitude aligns with that of the Bushmen, who famously quip: "Why should we plant, when there are so many mongomongo nuts in the world?" This reluctance stems not from incapacity but from a deliberate preference for leisure and minimal labour. Farming is serious graft, for many hours a day, often in an un-ergonomic posture. Hadza expend less energy and probably less time obtaining food than do their agricultural neighbours. This pattern extends globally. The Yamana people of South America, for instance, frustrated European employers with their "fits and starts" work rhythm, interspersed with long rest periods. What appeared to outsiders as laziness was, in reality, a cultural disposition that valued rest over continuous labor. Sahlins notes this reflects a fundamentally different relationship to work—one that does not equate productivity with virtue.
</p>

<p>
    From the perspective of industrial societies, where labor is endless and scarcity institutionalised, hunter-gatherers’ relaxed approach might seem irresponsible. But this nonchalance toward labour is a product of confidence in the hunter-gatherer economy, rather than evidence of foolishness or imprudence. Therefore, their refusal to embrace agriculture and their seemingly carefree attitude toward labour points to a trust in the success of their subsistence strategies.&nbsp;

<p><strong>Subsistence</strong></p>
<p>The so-called "evolution of economy" introduced a significant regression in human well-being. Neolithic societies, through the development of agriculture, achieved the ability to harvest surplus food in one season to survive others where nothing grew; a triumph over the "biological law of the minimum"—the principle that human survival is constrained by immediate ecological limits. The newfound capacity for surplus allowed for greater population growth and material expansion. But, on the whole, this did not raise the wellbeing of human beings. Yes, agriculture supported larger populations by providing a greater quantity of food but it was of much poorer quality. As humans dependent on fewer food sources, primarily crops, malnutrition increased. Even today, two or three main plants are the bulk of our consumption—wheat, rice and corn, which barely have any nutrients. When these crops failed, so too did the economic and social systems that depended on them, often leading to famine and widespread suffering (see: The Irish Potato Famine). Herders are deeply dependent on livestock health and face catastrophic losses from plagues, often forcing them to resort to fallback strategies like fishing. Sahlins asserts that "The amount of hunger increases relatively and absolutely with the evolution of culture". Perhaps neither progress nor regression is as linear; we are certainly better off in most respects than Agarian societies in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, starvation has become institutionalized in modern societies, with one-third to one-half of humanity going to bed hungry each night. Industrial economies simply failed to overcome scarcity and, in some ways, have exacerbated it. In contrast, as anthropologist Woodburn observes, for most hunters, it is "almost inconceivable" to die of hunger or endure prolonged deprivation.</p>

<p>Early agriculturalists where reliant on unsophisticated methods such as slash-and-burn cultivation which had them constantly grappling with soil exhaustion and drought. It also meant they had to work harder for less, as studies of the Hanunoo, a Philippine group practicing swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture, show that adults spend an average of three hours and twenty minutes per day on cultivation alone, excluding additional labour for food gathering, animal raising, and cooking, such that the overall workload of early agriculturalists certainly exceeded that of hunter-gatherers. As Sahlins notes, “The neolithic saw no particular improvement over the paleolithic in the amount of time required per capita for the production of subsistence; probably, with the advent of agriculture, people had to work harder".&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>

<p>Infectious diseases also increased, where parasite load increased with the size and density of a population, and the permanence of a settlement, where people mingled, stored food rots, filth accumulates, water supplied become contaminated and other sanitation issues. Pests also increased, and we face the uncertainty of the day when they evolve faster than our ability to cope with them (e.g. antibiotic resistant pathogens, or extreme plant pathogens, as in the southern corn leaf blight epidemic, which destroyed 60% of US corn production in a single summer). The domestication of animals also facilitated the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, leading to the emergence of several infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, and influenza, while urbanisation and globalisation made plagues deadlier on a wider scale This is not to mention the mental health issues unique to civilisation, and particularly urbanisation, alone. In contrast, hunter-gatherers spend much less time around animals because they do not domesticate them and do not store food because of their nomadic lifestyle. Overall, their lower rates of disease meant that their nutritional needs are lower, on top of their higher caloric intake and more varied diet. In fact, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300050233/health-and-the-rise-of-civilization/">paleopathological data</a> shows that the proportion of skeletons with pathologies increased after the Agricultural Revolution, specifically, increases in frequencies of skeletal lesions and iron deficiency anemia, and a decrease in height (from 5'9 to 5'5) in agricultural samples compared to hunter-gatherers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of this, structures of power and property emerged alongside agricultural advances, increasingly expropriating resources from individuals and concentrating wealth and entrenching inequality where surplus production served to benefit a privileged elite rather than ensuring collective security. Thus, even though the society produced surpluses, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few left the majority precariously exposed. Wherever civilisation springs up, you find an acute form of hierarchies and authoritarianism. On the other hand, hunter-gatherers have far less social stratification since there is no way to sustain a class of elite of non-producing people who live on surplus produced by others. Peasants—the majority of the Agarian population—often faced significant vulnerability to natural disasters than even the most precarious hunter-gatherer groups, such as droughts or floods, because of their dependence on elites and the systems of tribute and exploitation that governed their lives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this sense, poverty, in the final analysis, is a social construct rooted in the dynamics of civilisation that agriculture made possible, and not a natural condition. While the most "primitive" societies may have minimal material goods, they are not poor because poverty is not simply about having little; it is about the social relationships that define and reinforce inequality. It is a social status that emerged with the rise of civilisation, growing alongside the development of surplus production, private property, and class divisions. In stratified societies, some groups accumulate wealth while others are deprived.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Technocratic Dependency</strong></p>

<p>When it came to the means to achieve their desires, societies like the !Kungs' achieved material plenty with minimal effort because their tools and materials (stone, bone, wood, skin) "lay in abundance around them",&nbsp; were free for anyone to take, and could be worked with minimal technological complexity. Knowledge of how to build these technologies was also open to all. &nbsp;In contrast, modern technological systems, once introduced, tend to gain momentum and evolve in ways that individuals—or even large collectives—cannot fully understand or control. They create a dependency on complex, opaque systems that operate largely beyond human oversight. Consider the items in your own home. Even something as seemingly straightforward as a toilet and its plumbing system is likely beyond the understanding of most people. Few of us could build or repair such a system on our own, and fewer still have a grasp of the broader network of production, extraction, and infrastructure that makes these technologies possible. Slowly, they become coercive: at first, cars were optional tools, those who preferred walking could continue as before, while others could adopt vehicles to suit their needs. But as cars became more common, they transformed society. Regulations and laws emerged to manage the growing use of motorised transport, limiting the autonomy of drivers and enforcing strict adherence to traffic rules. Car ownership came with additional obligations, such as licensing, insurance, and maintenance. Even those who preferred walking found their autonomy restricted, as roads filled with vehicles and pedestrian movement became increasingly constrained by traffic flows and infrastructure designed for cars. Over time, the use of vehicles became practically mandatory, as cities and towns expanded under the assumption that people could travel long distances quickly. Jobs, shops, and essential services relocated beyond walking distance, making motorized transport a necessity for living a "normal" life. In short, once introduced, technologies take on a self-sustaining life of their own independent of anyones intentions, shaping the world and the people within it in ways that cannot be directed or reversed.</p>

<p>One of the most glaring contradictions of civilisation is that it relies on a stable environment to function, yet it actively degrades that very environment. This inherent tension makes civilisation ultimately self-destructive, as its foundations erode under its own weight. The planet is experiencing an unprecedented ecological crisis, marked by phenomena such as climate change, deforestation, the acidification of oceans, air and water pollution, soil erosion, and the loss of biodiversity on a massive scale. We are currently in the midst of the Holocene extinction, with extinction rates vastly exceeding natural background levels—by some estimates, a hundred to a thousand times higher. These environmental problems are not merely abstract threats; they represent clear evidence that the systems underpinning modern civilisation are unsustainable and may ultimately lead to collapse. By contrast, the hunter-gatherer way of life exemplifies a mode of existence that is far less taxing on the environment. For tens of thousands of years, humans lived as hunter-gatherers without significantly destabilising ecosystems or compromising the biosphere’s long-term health.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Loss of Autonomy</strong></p>

<p>Technology fosters large-scale, impersonal institutions that require strict control over human behavior. To sustain a technological society, individuals must be continuously engaged in building, maintaining, and consuming its outputs. This dependence necessitates mass obedience, not because of the specific purpose of any given technology, but because of the vast, interconnected systems required to produce and sustain it. Modern life is structured by rigid rules largely beyond individual control. For example, when traveling, one must adhere to traffic laws and the flow of vehicles. At work, individuals must follow rules set by employers, states, and organisations. Even those in positions of power, such as business owners, are constrained by the broader technological and economic systems within which they operate. They must adapt to external regulations, market demands, and the momentum of technological development, just as much as their employees must. As civilization advances, individuals—regardless of status—find themselves swept along by its trajectory. Behavior and even desires are shaped to align with the system’s requirements. Large-scale, highly organized systems demand coordination across thousands or even millions of people. Decisions in such systems, whether political, economic, or technological, are often made by a small group of elites—politicians, corporate executives, or technocrats. For the vast majority, these decisions are inaccessible and incomprehensible, given the complexity of modern technological systems. Citizens must also rely on distant, opaque institutions to manage their physical security, from the safety of nuclear power plants to the competence of regulatory bodies, employers, and governments. People are expected to trust that these systems will function in their best interests, even though they have little understanding of or influence over them. Whether these systems are governed dictatorially or democratically makes little practical difference to the average individual, as the decisions that shape their lives are fundamentally out of their hands. These problems are contingent and avoidable in smaller, non-technological communities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Economic Inequality</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;The standard of living for the poor majority, throughout most of human history following the Palaeolithic era, was constrained by subsistence economics. The majority of the population worked in agriculture or manual labor, producing just enough to survive. Any surplus wealth created by the society was extracted by elites through taxes, rents, or forced labour, and was offset by rising population sizes. For centuries, the living conditions of the poor changed incredibly little as they remained tied to minimal caloric needs and basic housing they always had. Meanwhile, for the rich, more property equaled more wealth, access to imported goods, accumulation of capital via investment trade and infrastructure, and so on. Any economic growth via agriculture or industrialism disproportionately, perhaps only, benefited the wealthy as they captured all the surplus. Essentially, for most of history, the poor stayed poor while the rich got richer. A report from Credit Suisse found that the top 1% of the global population held 43.4% of the world's wealth in 2020.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Desire-Means Misalignment</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The primordial "economic problem"—the basic challenge of aligning desires with material needs—had been easily solved with Paleolithic techniques. Nothing needed to be done. They deliberately negated technological advancement. It was only as culture reached the heights of its material abundance, through technological advances and the rise of capitalism, that humanity constructed a shrine to the unattainable: the idea of "Infinite Needs." This is now done through mechanisms such as advertising, consumer culture, and the commodification of nearly every aspect of life, ensuring that individuals are perpetually seeking more, and creating a structural misalignment between their desires and the means to achieve them. The economic system itself relies on this misalignment: scarcity is made explicit through calculated trade-offs, where resources such as wages, capital, or time are treated as finite and must be allocated among competing needs. Every act of consumption forecloses other possibilities—buying one thing means foregoing another. Even when desires are temporarily satisfied, the system quickly generates new ones, ensuring that satisfaction is always fleeting. This cycle of deprivation makes scarcity a perpetual condition, even when, technically, there is material abundance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our industrial society,&nbsp;increased productive capacity just ends up increasing consumption, driven by capitalist ambitions for generating evermore capital (guided by measures like “increase GDP”) and thereby increasing labour needs. Bertrand Russell almost a century ago captures this in a thought experiment:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At an individual level, this is verified by the Easterlin Paradox, based on economist Richard Easterlin’s paper "Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence". The paradox suggests that once your income reaches a certain level, any additional increase in earnings won't impact your overall happiness. He also found that consumption levels directly correlate with income levels, meaning that when people reach a certain satisfaction point, any increase in consumption also does not make them any more happier. The point is that in fact there hunter gatherer societies produce a surplus, and don't just "have enough to get by": every society produces a surplus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Problem is Civilisation</strong></p>

<p>The problem does not lie in the economic system but in civilisation itself. Land ceases to be a shared part of the biosphere and becomes a controlled, regimented resource subject to human domination. Wild animals are replaced by domesticated ones, bred by the billions a year and shaped to serve human purposes, and mass slaughtered. Humans, too, are transformed into instrumental resources whose primary function is to sustain and perpetuate civilisation. Autonomy is sacrificed as individuals are moulded to fit the demands of the system at the expense of their own interests and well-being. This applies even to those who are relatively affluent, as their roles within civilisation are defined by their utility to the larger structure rather than their intrinsic humanity. To that end, reform within this system as advocated by anarchists must therefore be rejected, as civilisation, by its very nature, is a means of domination. To attempt to use such a system to achieve liberation or egalitarianism is contradictory: domination cannot be a tool for dismantling hierarchy; it can only perpetuate it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as anarchist argue that Marxists are wrong in rely on the state—a hierarchical, authoritarian structure—as a tool to achieve a stateless, classless society given that the the state, by its very nature, fosters domination and inequality, and over time, Marxist political parties cease to act as workers and instead adopt the values and practices of the ruling class. So too do anarcho-primitivists extend this principle to their critique of civilisation and technology whose tools are tools of domination that cannot be repurposed to build a society based on liberation and equality. In other words, tools are objects that can be created by individuals or small groups in a straightforward and cooperative manner—things like spears, pots, or walls. These are simple, tangible creations that do not require extensive systems of extraction, production, and distribution. Technology, by contrast, refers to objects that depend on large-scale, interconnected systems. These systems of extraction, production, and consumption inherently require hierarchy, specialization, and control, reinforcing the dynamics of domination that primitivists critique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Then Why Did Agriculture ‘Win’ Out?</strong></p>

<p>Hunter-gatherers lived in small, mobile groups with very low population densities, maybe one person per ten square miles because their food sources were scattered and so they had to constantly move. They couldn’t carry large surpluses, so their population was naturally constrained. In contrast, agriculture allowed for denser populations. When you replace a forest with a field of wheat, you’re converting the land into a concentrated food source that can support many more people. Farmers could live shoulder-to-shoulder compared to the wide dispersal of hunter-gatherer bands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reproductive strategies also mattered. In a hunter-gatherer society, women had to space their children out by several years—four years was typical—because mothers had to carry their young as they moved. You couldn’t have multiple toddlers in tow when you’re constantly on the move, so methods like infanticide were used to manage population. Farming, changed this; once societies settled, women no longer needed to carry their children for long distances. They could have children more frequently, about every two years. Over time, this created an exponential growth in population that outgrew hunter-gatherer societies. Their sheer numbers also gave them an advantage in conflicts. Even if farmers were less healthy, a hundred farmers could still overwhelm a smaller group of healthy hunters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As populations expanded at the end of the Ice Age, hunter-gatherer bands faced a choice. They could adopt agriculture to support more people, or they could find ways to limit their growth—usually by sticking to their traditional practices. Some groups chose agriculture because there's an initial abundance that it brought, but it was temporary. Population growth quickly caught up with food production which meant: overwork, resource depletion and &nbsp;poorer health. Still, the groups that farmed expanded rapidly and displaced those who didn’t. They often drove out or outright eliminated hunter-gatherers. Over time, hunter-gatherers were pushed into the least desirable lands, the deserts, the mountains, the forests that weren’t useful for farming. Many others were forced to adapt or face extinction. So, agriculture 'won' because it could sustain more people, but it was not a more 'affluent' way of living.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Present-Day Primitvism</strong></p>

<p>It is true that present-day hunter-gatherer societies don’t quite fit the harsh image often painted of their lives being nasty and brutish, but many have been relegated to some of the world’s most marginal lands due to the expansion of farming communities. Because they’ve been in contact with agricultural societies for millennia, their lifestyles are not representational of what life was like before the advent of farming. The claim that human life improved with the transition from foraging to farming, is fundamentally about a much earlier era.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In practice, we cannot return to that pre-agricultural world. The genie is out of the box. Ours is a post-contact world, where the conditions necessary to restore the original productive capacities of hunter-gatherer societies no longer exist. There is simply no untouched, pre-contact hunter-gatherer society to return to. Even the few-hundred Amazonian tribes have been displaced through logging practices. And we have simply become too many. Even when they do not want to, Hunter Gatherers like the Indians at Dickson Mounds were forced to adopt farming in response to population growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even worse, the ethnographic data which Sahlins cites remains an account of displaced and disenfranchised peoples in post-contact conditions, and not those that were in their original productive capacities even by the 1960s. The historical and ecological disruptions caused by colonialism, industrialisation, and environmental degradation have fundamentally altered the landscapes and ecosystems that once sustained these societies. Early European contact brought with it new diseases, forced labor, violence, and cultural disruption. The San Bushmen which Sahlins cites through Richard Lee's descriptions in the 1960s, have today largely been displaced by modern agriculture and land policies, and only a minority continue a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with most now reliant on wage labour or government aid. The Eskimo no longer hunt whales due to disrupted marine ecosystems. In the Americas, many were forced to abandon their lifestyle and adopt Christianity. Almost all Australians Aboriginal groups have been settled in government-assigned communities or urban areas and live off welfare benefits. The Shoshoni’s pinon groves were timbered, and their hunting grounds were overtaken by cattle. Many Pygmy groups have been marginalised and now work for farming societies. Only the a few Hadza, a few Bushmen, the Sentinelese, and some scattered Amazonian tribes survive (though barely any ethnological data exists on the last two due to their isolation), and even they are increasingly exposed to pressures like tourism, trade, privatisation, deforestation, illegal logging and settlement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hadza are a great case in point, even though they're always pointed out as the prime example of unscathed hunter-gatherers. Since 1961, Tanzanian authorities have introduced initiatives to shift the Hadza toward settled ‘civilised’ lifestyles by offering goats and building houses to encourage farming and herding. They ignored the housing, and ate the goats. Still, the rapidly growing population of pastoralists and farmers has devastated the local ecosystem, eradicating much of the wildlife, destroying the berry groves, depleting the honey, and burning out the tubers, each of which traditionally contributed 20 percent of the Hadza diet's caloric intake. In 2000, the UAE bought a third of the Hadza territory so that the royal family could go hunting animals which Hadza hunters would have otherwise caught. For the past two decades or more, the Hadza have also been made into a commodified wildlife spectacle for tourists. Most recently with the influencer era, their entire identity/lifestyle has basically been turned into content for social media influencers in another layer of commodification. Their existence is used to fuel influencer engagement farms, every hunting trip is a gamified point optimised for algorithmic virality. They're kind of stuck in this weird loop where to make money, they now have to perform a hollow version of their traditional lifestyle for tourists, acting it out performatively. They would accompany tourists to hunting trips to hunt small animals not because it feeds them, but because that's what tourists want to see. For the sake of the show, the Hadza would act out certain religious ceremonies which would otherwise only be performed for a certain reasons, at a certain time and place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where as before they did not assign property values to things, the Hadza have now also been introduced to the cash economy and have access to village markets, all thanks to tourists. They are making money through entrance fees, selling souvenirs or working seasonal gigs in these tourism programmes, and a large chunk of that goes toward buying a new commodity they had never known before: booze. Alcoholism has become so endemic that during high tourist seasons, the men, women and children would drink and smoke weed all day. As a result of their alcohol addiction, AIDS and tubercolousis have now been introduced to their communities and the rate of murder has increased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At any rate, its clear that a literal return to the pre-contact hunter-gatherer conditions may well-nigh be impossible, but we may nevertheless draw inspiration from the values and principles of these societies to imagine alternatives ways of being.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individuals associated with this current do not wish to be adherents of an ideology, merely people who seek to become free individuals in free communities in harmony with one another and with the biosphere, and may therefore refuse to be limited by the term ‘anarcho-primitivist’ or any other ideological talking. At best, then, anarcho-primitivism is a convenient label used to characterise diverse individuals with a common project: the abolition of all power relations — e.g., structures of control, coercion, domination, and exploitation-and the creation of a form of community that excludes all such relations.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">–John Moore, in <i>A Primitivist Primer</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anarcho-Primitivism is a critique of civilisation and its institutional power structure, and not a prescription of personal practices. It is a structural critique. On an individual level, I have developed many aversions: I hate the sun, camping, outdoor activities. But, as we stipulated in the beginning, individual preferences and aversions are socially constructed and not innate. I am a product the cultural conditions of my life, that of a wealthy bourgeois, urbanised society. One can critique the conditions of one’s existence while also acknowledging how deeply those conditions inform one’s desires and behaviours. A modern human would not find it desirable to go live among the Hadza today, because she has been conditioned by bourgeois culture into having an assemblage of desires and impulses that have become needs. The means available to the Hadza simply would not satisfy those instilled needs. But this is not a counter-argument against anarcho-primitivism; it is simply a reflection of the unfortunate conditions shaped by modern civilisation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this sense, theory should be used as a critique of power and not an apologia in its service, as many have done when invoking the ‘State of Nature’. It is often the case for those who are engaged in the critical analysis of social and political phenomena that they find themselves accused of advocating for ideas, systems, or principles, that they merely introduce as diagnostic, heuristic tools; instruments for dismantling, challenging, opening up questions that have become closed to scrutiny, and not as prescriptive manuals for the literal instantiation of these ideas within present circumstances. This is particularly evident in discussions of political anarchism, as we find in figures such as Michel Foucault, James Scott, David Graeber, and others, who wished to produce highly empirical studies with rather anarchist themes as a form of critique through which to examine and denaturalise the power structures of the present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They do not call for the immediate dismantling of the state <i>tout court</i>, nor are they advocating for a 'return to a golden age'—the reactionary fascist's mythic logic—some romantic utopia that might be drawn from the more extreme fringes of anarchist thought. What they are doing is something rather different. They are, in effect, performing an act of what one might call defamiliarisation, a term drawn, appropriately enough, from literature. We may think of what they are doing as a suggestion to ‘try looking at it this way’ (‘try bringing this context to the work’, for example, or ‘try ascribing to it this aim, purpose, or thematic concern’), so that what once appeared puzzling may start to resonate, or so that what used to strike us as reasonable and perceptive comes to seem biased and simplistic. This perspectival shifting exercises is often performed through historicising the systems we inherited—the division of labour, the state, the market, hierarchies, institutions, the norms by which we live—of which we now take for granted and forget that they are not inevitable, eternal, divinely ordained, following from necessary premises; but are rather constructed, fallible, articulated at particular times and in particular ways for particular people, and therefore, potentially, alterable. It is worthwhile to have a small group of people such as these asking such questions, peeling back the layers of reification, to see how behind it all, power operates, how it stretches into institutions, identities, and permissible ways of life. The end goal is to offers us—the majority of society, the everyday unreflexive, <i>le tout-venant</i>, for whom relentless self-examination remains an impractical and perhaps undesirable luxury—the imaginative space, however tentatively, in which to consider more equitable, liberatory forms of social organisation. One can therefore hold the principles of anarcho-primitivism without advocating for their immediate implementation in contemporary circumstances, much like how other philosophical views—such as negative utilitarianism or antinatalism—can involve conclusions that are impractical or extreme when fully instantiated. This does not mean that the principles themselves are invalid. Their incompatibility with current conditions reflects the constraints of the present, not the ideas' intrinsic merits.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anti-anti-anarcho-primitivism&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When considering the primary site of human oppression, civilisation is to anarcho-primitivism what the state is to traditional anarchism, and what the economic system is to Marxism, and in their canonical forms, all these doctrines espouse total revolution as the dramatic showdown that ends it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-anti-anarcho-primitivism starts with the core insight that drives anarcho-primitivism: much of what we call ‘civilisation’ is the source of domination and hierarchy, especially through large-scale technologies and infrastructures that demand centralised oversight. Rather than dismiss that critique, it remains open to primitivist suspicions about the ways civilisation disciplines bodies, exploits ecosystems, and enforces progress as an unquestioned good. It resists any denial of primitivist insights and the traditional critiques levied against primitivism—hence the 'anti-anti'. It shares with traditional anarcho-primitivism, for instance, the suspicion of technology as merely a set of neutral tools, and accepts that much of it cannot be repurposed to serve egalitarian values without retaining many of its original structures of control (managerial oversight, hierarchy, labor exploitation, environmental degradation and so on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s suspicious of anyone arriving with a grand narrative of where history is heading, including capital 'A' Anarcho-Primitivism. This is its post-structuralist dimension. To think like a <i>post-structuralist</i> anti-anti-anarcho-primitivist is therefore to first stop thinking that power lies in one singular system that can be cleanly toppled. Power embedded within civilisation which leaves its droppings everywhere in a network of power relationships, scattered and sprouting up wherever people start organising themselves. It disperses through the very infrastructure, discourse, and values that define civilised life. That includes industrial-scale food production, global supply chains, and the social norms that demand people be 'useful' to the system instead of free to shape their own paths. The post-structuralist reading goes further and argue that our very languages, classifications, our ideas of 'progress' and ‘development’, and our standards for what counts as a good and successful life originate in these civilisational logics. The real challenge isn’t only to swap out big technology for smaller tools, but to also remain vigilant about how power infiltrates even the most localised, seemingly unproblematic practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where it differs from stricter forms of anarcho-primitivism; in its refusal to insist that we must abandon every aspect of civilisation at once and revert to a hypothetical state of nature. We can’t simply exit civilisation overnight without massive human suffering. What we can do is improvisational efforts; local attempts to live differently, to scale down technology and adopt cooperative and non-hierarchical crafts. These experiments chip away at the logic of endless growth, standardisation and top-down control. If new hierarchies start forming, people try something else; figure out what works and what doesn't, at least for a while, until new hierarchies start to rear their ugly heads. Even for the nomadic hunter-gatherers, hierarchies existed in the form of those least capable of moving, namely, infants, the elderly, the pregnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is that there isn’t a single final showdown in which all modern machinery collapses at once. Nor is there a neat historical narrative promising that a particular class or movement will inevitably triumph. And since civilisation expresses itself every time we reinforce norms of efficiency and large-scale coordination at the expense of autonomy, there’s no single lever to pull to topple it. The name itself—as cumbersome and somewhat tongue-in-cheek it may be—is meant to signal the idea’s refusal to become a banner under which someone rallies the masses for a singular, dramatic moment of revolt. That is to say, it is closer to a thought process than a doctrine, and it calls for something of a cultural revolution that opens the path to behavioural revolutions: What counts as “necessary” progress and affluence? Why do we take civilisation’s assumptions for granted? Are technologies neutral or do they bind us into harmful systems that might not be redeemable in their current forms?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this sense, you could not ever stitch anti-anti-anarcho-primitivism onto a flag. It’s all too easy to propogandise lefties like me with by waving a red banner, adding a few yellow stars, then invoking a sweeping historical narrative about the inevitable triumph of the masses. This fixation on bloody revolutions, the aesthetics of warfare, and heroic tales of a single, dramatic moment of liberation is all too common in leftist thought. &nbsp;It is anarcho with a small ‘a’ because it says: 'Whether it makes any difference to the world we wish to instantiate if we dropped that term ‘anarchism’ doesn't matter. Let’s not worry too much about whether we call ourselves anarchists'.&nbsp;</p>
