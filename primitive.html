<h1 style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:22px;"><strong>The State of Nature Thesis</strong></span></h1>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:44.79%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:768/600;" src="https://fee.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2019-04-09-at-82424-am-768x600.png" alt="International Trade Refutes Hobbes's Theory about the State of Nature" width="768" height="600"></figure>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">A recurring theme in the history of political thought that serves as justifications for the state and centralised authority, indeed for the very existence of organised societies, hinges on a concept that has come to be known as the State of Nature. The State of Nature is a hypothetical construct, never really empirically demonstrated, but is invoked a posteriori to explain how the origins of our current ways of governance arose, and at the same time to explain the nature of human beings themselves. It is both a story of beginnings and a justification for why things must remain as they are.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The story, as it is often told, begins with the image of hunter-gatherer societies—human beings stripped of the trappings of civilisation, inhabiting a condition not unlike that of wild animals. Here, in this imagined pre-political world, life is presented as a wretched affair: dominated by fear, violence, disease, famine, and the elements. The existence of these proto-humans is depicted as one of perpetual struggle, precariously balanced on the edge of survival, with scarcely a moment of leisure or reprieve. Tennyson’s image of nature as “red in tooth and claw” captures this grim vision, but it is Hobbes, of course, who gave it its most enduring form: the state of nature as a “war of all against all,” where human life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Hobbes’s central claim is that human beings, by their very nature, are selfish, aggressive, and driven by base impulses—creatures incapable of coexisting peacefully without some overarching force to impose order. Left to their own devices, human beings will descend into chaos, into the endless Darwinian struggle of bellum omnium contra omnes. It is from this dismal view of humanity that the need for the state arises. The state—or Leviathan, as Hobbes calls it—becomes at once a tool of governance and a necessary condition for civilised life. It is the bulwark against anarchy, the protector of life and property, the entity which makes liberty itself possible by ensuring order. The price for this order is the surrender of autonomy in favour of a higher, external authority that, by design, must be both powerful and coercive: The Hobbesian state. This is the so-called original ‘social contract’.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">This "dismal view" of hunter-gatherers is a deeply entrenched neolithic ethnocentrism and is also found in Adam Smith and ingrained in modern economic thought. In fact, the bias probably arose during the agricultural revolution, when settled agriculturalists likely viewed hunter-gatherers as inefficient and unsophisticated. This neolithic prejudice laid the groundwork for a narrative that hunter-gatherers lacked the capacity to utilise earth's resources effectively, justifying their dispossession by agricultural societies. The modern bourgeois ethnocentrism merely builds on the neolithic one, where contemporary capitalist economies perpetuate the idea of scarcity as the foundational principle of economic activity, in that it organises production and consumption around the assumption of limited resources and infinite wants. Given these presuppositions, it is only natural to perceive of hunter-gatherer economies as inherently deficient. As we will see, scarcity is not an inherent property of technological means but a relationship between means and ends. Modern economies emphasise scarcity because they are structured to generate and satisfy infinite desires; whereas hunter-gatherers’ finite and limited needs make their available resources adequate, even abundant.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">What we see today is that the Hobbesian assumption, or some variation of it, continues to exert its influence over contemporary justifications for the state and, more broadly, for the status quo of industrial capitalist economies. Those who brand themselves as the inheritors of the Enlightenment, defenders of “Western civilisation,” upholders of ‘reason’, progress, and order, frequently invoke this same narrative: that without the state, its institutions and its structures of control, humanity will inevitably revert to chaos. Steven Pinker, famously, in The Better Angels of Our Nature, presents an argument that echoes Hobbes in its fundamental assumptions. Early human societies, Pinker tells us, were marked by high levels of violence and brutality, and it was only with the advent of states and the rise of organised governance, that violence began to decline and prosperity began to flourish.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">In these accounts of the State of Nature, however, one hardly finds any concrete factual anthropological study of actual hunter-gatherer societies, of the state of nature itself, and instead we find the abstraction merely being lazily invoked as a relic of savagery to rhetorically justify why things must be as they are. To say that the state rescued us from a condition of perpetual violence is to say that we must accept its authority, hierarchies, and systems of control. Necessary, even morally good, the cage and the bowl are for the bird and the fish, who, having never known the skies nor the oceans, cannot begin to conceive of their possibility, and so their confines are justified as protection from abstracted dangers, and any dissatisfaction they feel can be a posteriori rationalised away as an inevitable feature of existence.</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-left:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:22px;"><strong>Reappraisal of Hunter Gatherers: The Original Affluent Society&nbsp;</strong></span></h1>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:47.35%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:790/474;" src="https://integralsoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hunter-gatherers-had-distinct-culinary-traditions-3.jpg" alt="Hunter-Gatherer Society – Integral Society" width="790" height="474"></figure>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Our perception of early hunter gatherers societies, which filled the imagination of State of Nature theorists, really only began to change significantly during the mid-half of the 20th century after new research produced by various anthropologists and archeologists, with which the anthropologist Michael Sahlins had synthesised and published as evidence for what he called the <i>The Original Affluent Society</i>, publishing an essay in that name.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">In it, he shows that hunter-gatherers were not locked in a desperate struggle for survival; their lives were in fact characterised by affluence. By "affluence," Sahlins refers to the satisfaction of wants, which may be "easily satisfied" either by producing much or desiring little. When we consider wants or desires, the central question becomes: <i>whose</i> desires? The concept of “affluence” <i>simplicter</i> is conceptually incoherent. It is inherently evaluative, and all evaluative terms require contextual indexing. Specifically, they must be tied to the affective cluster of mental states that represent an agent's desires, as well as the means available to fulfil those desires. Any attempt to universalise the concept of affluence—such as equating it solely with material abundance—inevitably smuggles in normative assumptions about which desires (which affective states) matter. This is precisely what early anthropologists did when they projected their bourgeois desires onto hunter-gatherer societies.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">It is a descriptive fact that desires can either be limited (finite) or expanded (almost infinitely) through cultural practices. With this in mind, we arrive at the following formulation of affluence:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><i>A society achieves affluence if and only if it can align its culturally defined desires with its available means.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">In this framework, we need only show that hunter-gatherer societies achieved affluence by aligning their culturally limited desires with their readily available means, whereas later societies did not. According to Sahlins' topology, there are two models towards affluence:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<ol style="padding-left:48px;">

    </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Affluence arises through the production of goods to meet an ever-expanding set of desires. The pursuit of industrial productivity to fulfil these growing desires creates a cycle of consumption, labour, and production that is inherently unfulfilling. People are enslaved to the process of acquiring more, and, as a result, even in wealthy societies, individuals often feel "poor" in terms of life satisfaction or contentment. Economic progress in this model is seen as the narrowing of the gap between limited means (resources) and unlimited wants (needs and desires). Industrial productivity theoretically makes ever more goods available to satisfy human wants.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;text-indent:36.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;text-indent:36.0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><i>Many desires + High consumption rates = Poverty (for most members)</i></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>

    </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The number of material wants is inherently small and finite. The technical means of production remain relatively stable and are sufficiently adequate to meet desires. These desires are easily satisfied because cultural practices have acculturated people to desire less. In this model, the society operates in a state of "abundance" despite having limited material resources, as its members are satisfied with fewer material goods.</span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Hunter Gatherers Are Healthier than Us</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Something that readers will find fascinating is that hunter gatherers are actually far better nourished than most people in the modern world, and certainly, better that civilisations throughout human history (which fare much worse). Hunter gatherer calorie and nutrient consumption met or exceeded the standards of the National Research Council of America. For example, during a four-day observation at Hemple Bay, the mean daily calorie intake was 2,160 per person, while at Fish Creek, it was 2,130 calories over 11 days. The San Bushmen consumed around 2,140 calories per day, which exceeds their estimated requirement of 1,975 calories when adjusted for body weight, activity levels, and population demographics, and the Hadza consumed around 3000 per day. Malnutrition was rare in all cases. And the surplus is not wasted but often goes to dogs. Compare this with the urban poor in many developed nations who consume around 1500 calories per day and where malnutrition is prevalent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><strong>The Material plenty of Hunter Gatherers</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Food was also plentiful and easily accessed. Looking at the Dobe !Kung Bushmen at a single year, despite the harsh environmental conditions, including a low annual rainfall of only 6 to 10 inches, the Dobe region exhibited a "surprising abundance of vegetation." Among the food resources, the energy-rich mangetti nut stood out as particularly plentiful, with "millions of the nuts rotting on the ground each year for want of picking." A single individual’s efforts in hunting and gathering could support four to five people. In effect, Bushmen food production was more efficient than French farming prior to World War II, when over 20% of the population was engaged in feeding the rest.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The women of southeastern Australian Aboriginals, who typically engaged in gathering, spent about six hours a day away from camp, but "half of that time being loitered away in the shade or by the fire." Men, who left for hunting around the same time, would also return together with the women, their time sufficing to provide for the camp's needs. It is estimated that six hours a day of such work "abundantly sufficed" to meet their needs, and that the country "could have supported twice the number of Blacks [sic] we found in it." A few minutes of fishing could provide enough food for an entire tribe, as a 19th century traveller put it: "Throughout all the country along the eastern coast, the blacks have never suffered so much from scarcity of food as many commiserating writers have supposed." Another observer notes that "the native experiences no difficulty whatever in procuring food in abundance all the year round." 600 Aboriginals were seen living together, sustained by abundant fish from the lake and the leaves of local plants. Similarly, during the Murray River’s annual inundation, freshwater crayfish appeared in such vast numbers that 400 people could subsist on them for weeks, while another 400 could have been supported by the surplus left uneaten. In the absence of European disruption, Aboriginals could "in three or four hours procure as much food as would last for the day, and that without fatigue or labour." Aboriginals held a preference for making life "as easy as possible" when resources like game and water were readily available: "they can obtain, in two or three hours, a sufficient supply of food for the day", however, their customary approach is to "roam indolently from spot to spot, lazily collecting it as they wander along."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Meanwhile, the Hadza people in Africa live in an area of abundant resources near Lake Eyasi, and during the long dry season, the men are more likely to spend their time gambling than hunting, sometimes even losing the very metal-tipped arrows needed for big game, leaving the more active hunting to a small minority. Women, responsible for vegetable collecting, also work at a leisurely pace and without extended effort. Over the course of a year, the average time spent obtaining food is "less than two hours a day." Yet despite this relaxed approach, the Hadza, like their Australian counterparts, consistently obtain sufficient food.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><strong>2-5 hour work day: Hunter Gatherers Work Less Than We Do and Have More Fun</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Hunter-gatherers do not work hard. Studies of their subsistence activities reveal that the average amount of time spent each day on acquiring and preparing food is remarkably low—just two to five hours per person. “Foragers,” Sahlins observed, “keep bankers’ hours".</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Unlike the assumptions of industrial society that labor and resources should be pushed to their maximum limits to achieve surplus and accumulation, the hunter-gatherer's an "economy of specific, limited objectives," in that their production is driven by the immediate need to satisfy present requirements rather than the desire for surplus. The result is a work pattern that is deliberately "erratic": when the objectives are met, work ceases, and members of the society begin to prioritise rest or social activities. On top of that, the McArthur 1960 study of Australian hunter-gatherers notes that "The quantity of food gathered in one day by any of these groups could in every instance have been increased." Women, who generally engaged in daily food gathering, took frequent rests and did not exhaust their daylight hours in this task. Meanwhile, the men’s efforts were even more sporadic, often taking a day of rest after a successful hunt: "Perhaps they judge what they consider to be enough, and when that is collected they stop."</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The Arnhem Landers even invested time in cultivating dietary diversity to avoid monotony and were not satisfied with "a bare existence." Anthropologists found the existence of individuals who were 'full-time craftsmen', but who other than their craft, occasionally exerted themselves in activities like netting fish or gathering bees' nests, but otherwise spent most of their time "talking, eating, and sleeping." They were not an anomaly: much of the time saved by efficient subsistence practices translated into literal “spare time,” spent in rest, sleep, chatting and gossiping. Leisure, in other words, was not incidental to the subsistence economy but deliberately featured in it. Hunters follow "a day on and a day off" pattern, with significant time spent in leisure, including daytime sleep.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Of the the Arnhem Landers' camp population, only 65% were "effective food producers", and among the producers, subsistence labor occupied only 36% of their time. This translates to each productive individual working about two and a half days per week, or roughly 15 hours in total. Sahlins notes that, on average, this amounts to "2 hours 9 minutes per day," which is even less than the labor demands observed among Arnhem Land hunters. This left “3-1/2 to 5-1/2 days available for other activities”. The Dobe Bushmen, on the other hand, spend only a few days each week engaged in food collection or related subsistence activities. Women, for example, typically gather enough food in a single day to feed their families for the next three days. The rest of their time is spent resting in camp, visiting neighboring camps, engaging in crafts like embroidery, or entertaining visitors. Even during days spent at home, the necessary "kitchen routines" such as cooking, cracking nuts, collecting firewood, and fetching water require only one to three hours of their time. A man might hunt intensively for a week and then take two or three weeks off. When hunting proves unproductive—whether due to bad luck or cultural beliefs involving magical practices—men might suspend their efforts for a month or more. During these breaks, activities like visiting, hosting, and particularly dancing become central to their lives.</span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Hunter-gatherers' low standard of living is culturally and intentionally defined. Anthropologists found relatively few possessions with them, but they were content with this, in fact, this was a "matter of policy" and not a misfortune: "Want not, lack not" is their credo. It cannot be the case that this was because they were too busy with 'food quests', because anthropologists testify that foraging and hunting was "so successful that half the time the people seem not to know what to do with themselves." They also did not care so much for property, as nomadic movement greatly depreciated property value; the hunters' material wealth quickly becomes a burden. One striking account highlights this disposition:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><i>We were humiliated by the realization of how little there was we could give to the Bush­ men. Almost everything seemed likely to make life more difficult for them by adding to the litter and weight of their daily round. They themselves had practically no possessions: a loin strap, a skin blanket and a leather satchel. There was nothing that they could not assemble in one minute, wrap up in their blankets and carry on their shoulders for a journey of a thousand miles. They had no sense of possession.&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Clearly, what was a necessity for these researchers was not so culturally instituted for hunter gatherers. This made them simply lack an interest in developing their technology—as a matter of choice. This is precisely how their are affluent (incidentally, if you have ever met a super-rich individual who has arrived via the Galbraithean road, you might notice similar behaviour of indifference to material possessions). As Sahlins notes, "They have the kind of nonchalance that would be appropriate to a people who have mastered the problems of production."</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Another anthropologist describes the !Kung's indifference to material possessions:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><i>The European observer has the impression that these [YahganJ Indians place no value whatever on their utensils and that they have completely forgotten the effort it took to make them. Actually, no one clings to his few goods and chattels which, as it is, are often and easily lost, but just as easily replaced. . . . The Indian does not even exercise care when he could conveniently do so. A European is likely to shake his head at the boundless indifference of these people who drag brand-new objects, precious clothing, fresh provisions, and valuable items through thick mud, or abandon them to their swift destruction by children and dogs. . . . Expensive things that are given them are treasured for a few hours, out of curiousity; after that they thoughtlessly let everything deteriorate in the mud and wet. The less they own, the more comfortable they can travel, and what is ruined they occasionally replace. Hence, they are completely indif­ferent to any material possessions.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The upshot is that they are not "poor" or "restricted" due to a lack of material possessions, but are rather "free" because they do not experience the burdens and anxieties associated with material accumulation. "Economic Man" is a modern byproduct of capitalist ideologies which claims that humans are naturally acquisitive and driven by materialistic impulses. But, it turns out, this is not a fact about human nature because we find counterexamples in hunter-gatherer societies who had simply never institutionalised acquisitiveness, so the desire for material goods simply was not culturally emphasised for it to have the need to be suppressed. Thus, hunter gatherers do not see themselves as lacking given that their sufficiency-oriented way of life indexes a different set of desires that are easily met.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><strong>Prodigality</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The economic behaviour of hunter-gatherers can be understood as a reaction to their context of abundance. The notion of “prodigality”—the immediate consumption of available resources—speaks to the psychological and cultural disposition that emerges from a society that operates without the constraints of market economies. Without the pressure of scarcity or accumulation, the hunter-gatherers’ behaviour reflects a sense of economic ease and satisfaction that is not dictated by the cycles of production and consumption that dominate modern life.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The Hadza are a great case in point on how hunter gatherers avoid surplus and limit desires to meet the stipulated criteria for affluence. They remain surrounded by cultivators in East Africa but have historically refused to adopt farming, citing "too much hard work" as their reason. Their attitude aligns with that of the Bushmen, who famously quip: "Why should we plant, when there are so many mongomongo nuts in the world?" This reluctance to engage in agriculture reflects not a lack of capacity but a deliberate choice to prioritise leisure and a less labour-intensive lifestyle. Hadza expend less energy and probably less time obtaining food than do their agricultural neighbours. This finding highlights a fundamental distinction: hunter-gatherer societies often achieve sufficiency with minimal labour, while agricultural societies are built on sustained, intensive effort.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">This pattern is not unique to Africa. Sahlins brings in accounts of the Yamana people of South America to illustrate a similar attitude. European employers often expressed frustration with Yamana workers, noting their inability to engage in continuous hard labour. As Gusinde describes, the Yamana’s work rhythm consisted of "fits and starts," followed by extended periods of rest. This behaviour, incomprehensible to Europeans accustomed to steady labour, was dismissed as a "natural disposition" of the Yamana. But as Sahlins suggests, this "disposition" is better understood as a reflection of a fundamentally different relationship to labour—one shaped by a culture that does not equate productivity with virtue.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">This nonchalance toward labour is a product of confidence in the hunter-gatherer economy, rather than evidence of foolishness or imprudence. From the perspective of industrial societies, where scarcity is institutionalised and labour is endless, the relaxed approach of hunter-gatherers might appear irrational or irresponsible. However, this interpretation relies on a mistaken premise: that hunter-gatherers live on the edge of survival. On the contrary, their economies are clearly marked by abundance and sufficiency. Therefore, their refusal to embrace agriculture and their seemingly carefree attitude toward labour are not signs of ignorance or carelessness but of a deep-seated trust in the success of their subsistence strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:48.92%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:1586/1581;" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-UbPun4TP3qCPKoFTy4FU3k?se=2024-12-24T15%3A09%3A13Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2024-08-04&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D299%2C%20immutable%2C%20private&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3De85793a1-7445-441e-bc20-461127b65ac5&amp;sig=LDES16Q0n0f0N68e45VEOtqn2sE7JfY2Z8zyymWhyZs%3D" alt="Output image" width="1586" height="1581"></figure>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Subsistence</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The so-called "evolution of economy" introduced a significant regression in human well-being. Neolithic societies, through the development of agriculture, achieved the ability to harvest surplus food in one season to survive others where nothing grew; a triumph over the "biological law of the minimum"—the principle that human survival is constrained by immediate ecological limits. The newfound capacity for surplus allowed for greater population growth and material expansion. But, on the whole, this did not raise the wellbeing of human beings. Yes, agriculture supported larger populations by providing a greater quantity of food but it was of much poorer quality. As humans dependent on fewer food sources, primarily crops, malnutrition increased. They were vulnerable to soil depletion: when crops failed, so too did the economic and social systems that depended on them, often leading to famine and widespread suffering. Herders are deeply dependent on livestock health and face catastrophic losses from plagues, often forcing them to resort to fallback strategies like fishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Similarly, early agriculturalists where reliant on unsophisticated methods such as slash-and-burn cultivation, thus constantly grappling with soil exhaustion and drought. They even had to work harder for less, as studies of the Hanunoo, a Philippine group practicing swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture, show that adults spend an average of three hours and twenty minutes per day on cultivation alone. This figure excludes additional labor for food gathering, animal raising, and cooking, suggesting that the overall workload of early agriculturalists exceeded that of hunter-gatherers. As Sahlins notes, “The neolithic saw no particular improvement over the paleolithic in the amount of time required per capita for the production of subsistence; probably, with the advent of agriculture, people had to work harder.” Sahlins asserts that "The amount of hunger increases relatively and absolutely with the evolution of culture." Today, in a world of unprecedented technological power, starvation has become institutionalised with one-third to one-half of humanity going to bed hungry each night. Modern industrial economies have failed to overcome scarcity and, in some ways, have exacerbated it. In contrast, as anthropologist Woodburn observes, for most hunters, it is "almost inconceivable" to die of hunger or endure prolonged deprivation.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Disease</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Infectious diseases also increased, where parasite load increased with the size and density of a population, and the permanence of a settlement, where people mingled, stored food rots, filth accumulates, water supplied become contaminated and other sanitation issues. In contrast, hunter-gatherers spend much less time around animals because they do not domesticate them and do not store food because of their nomadic lifestyle. Overall, their lower rates of disease meant that their nutritional needs are lower, on top of their higher caloric intake and more varied diet. In fact, </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300050233/health-and-the-rise-of-civilization/"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">paleopathological data</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"> shows that the proportion of skeletons with pathologies increased after the Agricultural Revolution, specifically, increases in frequencies of skeletal lesions and a decrease in stature in agricultural samples compared to hunter-gatherers.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Power structures</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">On top of this, structures of power and property emerged alongside agricultural advances, increasingly expropriating resources from individuals and concentrating wealth and entrenching inequality where surplus production served to benefit a privileged elite rather than ensuring collective security. Thus, even though the society produced surpluses, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few left the majority precariously exposed. Wherever civilisation springs up, you find an acute form of hierarchies and authoritarianism. On the other hand, hunter-gatherers have far less social stratification since there is no way to sustain a class of elite of non-producing people who live on surplus produced by others. Peasants—the majority of the Agarian population—often faced significant vulnerability to natural disasters than even the most precarious hunter-gatherer groups, such as droughts or floods, because of their dependence on elites and the systems of tribute and exploitation that governed their lives.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">In this sense, poverty, in the final analysis, is a social construct rooted in the dynamics of civilisation that agriculture made possible, and not a natural condition. While the most "primitive" societies may have minimal material goods, they are not poor because poverty is not simply about having little; it is about the social relationships that define and reinforce inequality. It is a social status that emerged with the rise of civilisation, growing alongside the development of surplus production, private property, and class divisions. In stratified societies, some groups accumulate wealth while others are deprived.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Technocratic Dependency</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">When it came to the means to achieve their desires, societies like the !Kungs' achieved material plenty with minimal effort because their tools and materials (stone, bone, wood, skin) "lay in abundance around them",<span>&nbsp; </span>were free for anyone to take, and could be worked with minimal technological complexity. Knowledge of how to build these technologies was also open to all. &nbsp;In contrast, modern technological systems, once introduced, tend to gain momentum and evolve in ways that individuals—or even large collectives—cannot fully understand or control. They create a dependency on complex, opaque systems that operate largely beyond human oversight. Consider the items in your own home. Even something as seemingly straightforward as a toilet and its plumbing system is likely beyond the understanding of most people. Few of us could build or repair such a system on our own, and fewer still have a grasp of the broader network of production, extraction, and infrastructure that makes these technologies possible. Slowly, they become coercive: at first, cars were optional tools, those who preferred walking could continue as before, while others could adopt vehicles to suit their needs. But as cars became more common, they transformed society. Regulations and laws emerged to manage the growing use of motorised transport, limiting the autonomy of drivers and enforcing strict adherence to traffic rules. Car ownership came with additional obligations, such as licensing, insurance, and maintenance. Even those who preferred walking found their autonomy restricted, as roads filled with vehicles and pedestrian movement became increasingly constrained by traffic flows and infrastructure designed for cars. Over time, the use of vehicles became practically mandatory, as cities and towns expanded under the assumption that people could travel long distances quickly. Jobs, shops, and essential services relocated beyond walking distance, making motorized transport a necessity for living a "normal" life. In short, once introduced, technologies take on a self-sustaining life of their own independent of anyones intentions, shaping the world and the people within it in ways that cannot be directed or reversed.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">One of the most glaring contradictions of civilisation is that it relies on a stable environment to function, yet it actively degrades that very environment. This inherent tension makes civilisation ultimately self-destructive, as its foundations erode under its own weight. The planet is experiencing an unprecedented ecological crisis, marked by phenomena such as climate change, deforestation, the acidification of oceans, air and water pollution, soil erosion, and the loss of biodiversity on a massive scale. We are currently in the midst of the Holocene extinction, with extinction rates vastly exceeding natural background levels—by some estimates, a hundred to a thousand times higher. These environmental problems are not merely abstract threats; they represent clear evidence that the systems underpinning modern civilisation are unsustainable and may ultimately lead to collapse. By contrast, the hunter-gatherer way of life exemplifies a mode of existence that is far less taxing on the environment. For tens of thousands of years, humans lived as hunter-gatherers without significantly destabilising ecosystems or compromising the biosphere’s long-term health.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Loss of Autonomy</strong></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Technology fosters large-scale, impersonal institutions that require strict control over human behavior. To sustain a technological society, individuals must be continuously engaged in building, maintaining, and consuming its outputs. This dependence necessitates mass obedience, not because of the specific purpose of any given technology, but because of the vast, interconnected systems required to produce and sustain it. Modern life is structured by rigid rules largely beyond individual control. For example, when traveling, one must adhere to traffic laws and the flow of vehicles. At work, individuals must follow rules set by employers, states, and organisations. Even those in positions of power, such as business owners, are constrained by the broader technological and economic systems within which they operate. They must adapt to external regulations, market demands, and the momentum of technological development, just as much as their employees must. As civilization advances, individuals—regardless of status—find themselves swept along by its trajectory. Behavior and even desires are shaped to align with the system’s requirements. Large-scale, highly organized systems demand coordination across thousands or even millions of people. Decisions in such systems, whether political, economic, or technological, are often made by a small group of elites—politicians, corporate executives, or technocrats. For the vast majority, these decisions are inaccessible and incomprehensible, given the complexity of modern technological systems. Citizens must also rely on distant, opaque institutions to manage their physical security, from the safety of nuclear power plants to the competence of regulatory bodies, employers, and governments. People are expected to trust that these systems will function in their best interests, even though they have little understanding of or influence over them. Whether these systems are governed dictatorially or democratically makes little practical difference to the average individual, as the decisions that shape their lives are fundamentally out of their hands. These problems are contingent and avoidable in smaller, non-technological communities.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>Desire-Means Misalignment</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">The primordial "economic problem"—the basic challenge of aligning desires with material needs—had been easily solved with Paleolithic techniques. Nothing needed to be done. They deliberately negated technological advancement. It was only as culture reached the heights of its material abundance, through technological advances and the rise of capitalism, that humanity constructed a shrine to the unattainable: the idea of "Infinite Needs." This is now done through mechanisms such as advertising, consumer culture, and the commodification of nearly every aspect of life, ensuring that individuals are perpetually seeking more, and creating a structural misalignment between their desires and the means to achieve them. The economic system itself relies on this misalignment: scarcity is made explicit through calculated trade-offs, where resources such as wages, capital, or time are treated as finite and must be allocated among competing needs. Every act of consumption forecloses other possibilities—buying one thing means foregoing another. Even when desires are temporarily satisfied, the system quickly generates new ones, ensuring that satisfaction is always fleeting. This cycle of deprivation makes scarcity a perpetual condition, even when, technically, there is material abundance.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">In our industrial society,<span>&nbsp;</span>increased productive capacity just ends up increasing consumption, driven by capitalist ambitions for generating evermore capital (guided by measures like “increase GDP”) and thereby increasing labour needs. Bertrand Russell almost a century ago captures this in a thought experiment:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0cm 36.0pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><i>Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?</i></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">At an individual level, this is verified by the Easterlin Paradox, based on economist Richard Easterlin’s paper "Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence". The paradox suggests that once your income reaches a certain level, any additional increase in earnings won't impact your overall happiness. He also found that consumption levels directly correlate with income levels, meaning that when people reach a certain satisfaction point, any increase in consumption also does not make them any more happier. The point is that in fact there hunter gatherer societies produce a surplus, and don't just "have enough to get by": every society produces a surplus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><strong>The Problem is Civilisation</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">The problem does not lie in the economic system but in civilisation itself. Land ceases to be a shared part of the biosphere and becomes a controlled, regimented resource subject to human domination. Wild animals are replaced by domesticated ones, bred by the billions a year and shaped to serve human purposes, and mass slaughtered. Humans, too, are transformed into instrumental resources whose primary function is to sustain and perpetuate civilisation. Autonomy is sacrificed as individuals are moulded to fit the demands of the system at the expense of their own interests and well-being. This applies even to those who are relatively affluent, as their roles within civilisation are defined by their utility to the larger structure rather than their intrinsic humanity. To that end, reform within this system as advocated by anarchists must therefore be rejected, as civilisation, by its very nature, is a means of domination. To attempt to use such a system to achieve liberation or egalitarianism is contradictory: domination cannot be a tool for dismantling hierarchy; it can only perpetuate it.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Just as anarchist argue that Marxists are wrong in rely on the state—a hierarchical, authoritarian structure—as a tool to achieve a stateless, classless society given that the the state, by its very nature, fosters domination and inequality, and over time, Marxist political parties cease to act as workers and instead adopt the values and practices of the ruling class. So too do anarcho-primitivists extend this principle to their critique of civilisation and technology whose tools are tools of domination that cannot be repurposed to build a society based on liberation and equality. In other words, tools are objects that can be created by individuals or small groups in a straightforward and cooperative manner—things like spears, pots, or walls. These are simple, tangible creations that do not require extensive systems of extraction, production, and distribution. Technology, by contrast, refers to objects that depend on large-scale, interconnected systems. These systems of extraction, production, and consumption inherently require hierarchy, specialization, and control, reinforcing the dynamics of domination that primitivists critique.</p>

<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Theory should be used as a critique of power and not an apologia in its the service. It is often the case for those who are engaged in the critical analysis of social and political phenomena that they find themselves accused of advocating for ideas, systems, or principles, that they merely introduce as diagnostic, heuristic tools; instruments for dismantling, challenging, opening up questions that have become closed to scrutiny, and not as prescriptive manuals for the literal instantiation of these ideas within present circumstances. This is particularly evident in discussions of political anarchism, as we find in figures such as Michel Foucault, James Scott, David Graeber, and others, who wished to produce highly empirical studies with rather anarchist themes as a form of critique through which to examine and denaturalise the power structures of the present.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">They do not call for the immediate dismantling of the state tout court, nor are they advocating for a 'return to a golden age'—the reactionary fascist's mythic logic—some romantic primitivist utopia that might be drawn from the more extreme fringes of anarchist thought. What they are doing is something rather different. They are, in effect, performing an act of what one might call defamiliarisation, a term drawn, appropriately enough, from literature. We may think of what they are doing as a suggestion to ‘try looking at it this way’ (‘try bringing this context to the work’, for example, or ‘try ascribing to it this aim, purpose, or thematic concern’), so that what once appeared puzzling may start to resonate, or so that what used to strike us as reasonable and perceptive comes to seem biased and simplistic. This perspectival shifting exercises is often performed through historicising the systems we inherited—the state, the market, hierarchies, institutions, the norms by which we live—of which we now take for granted and forget that they are not inevitable, eternal, divinely ordained, following from necessary premises; but are rather constructed, fallible, articulated at particular times and in particular ways for particular people, and therefore, potentially, alterable. It is worthwhile to have a small group of people such as these asking such questions, peeling back the layers of reification, to see how behind it all, power operates, how it stretches into institutions, identities, and permissible ways of life. The end goal is to offers us—the majority of society, the everyday unreflexive, <i>le tout-venant</i>, for whom relentless self-examination remains an impractical and perhaps undesirable luxury—the imaginative space, however tentatively, in which to consider more equitable, liberatory forms of social organisation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm;">One can therefore hold the principles of anarcho-primitivism without advocating for their immediate implementation in contemporary circumstances, much like how other philosophical views—such as negative utilitarianism or antinatalism—can involve conclusions that are impractical or extreme when fully instantiated. This does not mean that the principles themselves are invalid. Their incompatibility with current conditions reflects the constraints of the present, not the ideas' intrinsic merits. After all, we live in a post-contact world, where the conditions necessary to restore the original productive capacities of hunter-gatherer societies no longer exist. There is simply no untouched, pre-contact hunter-gatherer society to return to. The historical and ecological disruptions caused by colonialism, industrialisation, and environmental degradation have fundamentally altered the landscapes and ecosystems that once sustained these societies. The Eskimo no longer hunt whales due to disrupted marine ecosystems. The Bushmen have been deprived of game by colonial grazing practices. The Shoshoni’s pinon groves were timbered, and their hunting grounds were overtaken by cattle. A literal return to the pre-contact hunter-gatherer conditions may well nigh be impossible, but we may nevertheless draw inspiration from the values and principles of these societies to imagine alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin:0cm;">Even if such a society did exist, a modern human, shaped by bourgeois culture and its institutionalised desires and impulses would not want to live there, given that the means available in such societies simply would not satisfy those instilled impulses. This is not a is not a counter-argument; it is simply a reflection of the conditions shaped by modern civilisation.</p>
