        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:44.79%;">
            <img style="aspect-ratio:768/600;" src="https://fee.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2019-04-09-at-82424-am-768x600.png" alt="International Trade Refutes Hobbes's Theory about the State of Nature" width="768" height="600">
        </figure>
        
        <p>17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes popularised the State of Nature hypothetical construct, in which pre-political humans are framed as selfish, chaotic, and perpetually at war. It’s designed to make the point that, without some central authority, life would descend into total anarchy. From there, it’s a short step away from justifying the need for a powerful, centralised state—the Leviathan—as the only thing standing between humanity and complete disorder.</p>
        
        <p>This idea that hunter-gatherers were by nature violent, inefficient, and clueless likely stems from an early prejudice that evolved with the agricultural revolution. Early foragers-turned-farmers 10,000 years ago, observing that hunter-gatherers neither cultivated fields nor built permanent settlements, probably assumed that these societies were ignorant and incapable of 'properly' doing anything productive with the land. This prejudice fuelled justifications for the dispossession of hunter-gatherers, such as what the Europeans did when they landed on the shores of the New World, as exemplified by the rhetoric of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1823:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>“But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness...”</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>But, as we will see later on, hunter-gatherer groups were not ignorant at all; even when surrounded by farming communities, they actively refused to adopt agriculture because they recognised the vulnerabilities it introduced (e.g., dependence on crop yields, susceptibility to famine) and the benefits they had: less work, more freedom, no lords, no taxes, a more intimate relationship with nature, and more food, and certainly a healthier diet. It’s not as though they failed to grasp basic agricultural principles; understanding that plants grow from seeds under favourable conditions isn’t exactly rocket science (though subsistence farming like large-scale irrigation became much more complicated after the Stone Age). As practically all states eventually found out, the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer to agriculturalists is not easy; it needed significant institutional and cultural shifts such as private property rights and the weakening of egalitarian communal sharing norms to overcome the free-rider problem and incentivise individual labour. Small-scale nomadic hunter-gatherers simply didn’t find these trade-offs worth it. Farming was only a good option if your population is becoming too high for the local environment to support since crops yield far more tons per acre than berries and nuts.</p>
        
        <p>It was also not true that hunter-gatherers inefficiently managed their environments. In many cases, they practiced sophisticated ecological strategies, like ‘firestick burning’, where they intentionally burned vegetation to improve hunting conditions, encourage biodiversity, and manage resources sustainably. This efficiency was simply invisible to agriculturalists who measured productivity in terms of crop yields and surplus.</p>
        
        <p>Nevertheless, agriculture made land more valuable, labour less so, and created the idea of surplus production to protect against annual variation in crop yield. No longer needing a nomadic lifestyle, agrarian settlements expanded and began to tie the legitimacy of land use to its transformation into private property and productive output. This underlying Neolithic prejudice reached its zenith in the economics of Adam Smith, where the development of property and surplus production was central to economic 'progress', and societies that didn’t fit this mould were therefore inherently deficient. Modern bourgeois thought—seen, for instance, in Steven Pinker’s neo-Hobbesian outlook—builds on the same basic prejudice, but now repackages it to fit the capitalist assumptions that production and consumption must be organised around the principle of scarcity (limited resources) and the belief in infinite human wants. From this perspective, it was no wonder that hunter-gatherer societies, which focused on sufficiency and limited desires rather than surplus accumulation, appear hopelessly inadequate.</p>
        
        <p>If we accept the Hobbesian story that's, as I've argued, grounded on the Neolithic prejudice, then we are also accepting the hierarchies, control systems, and coercive structures of the state as unavoidable, even beneficial. But the entire narrative hinges on speculative philosophy about what we believe life was like before the agricultural revolution. Unfortunately, we do not have time machines to travel back 12,000 years ago and observe pre-contact hunter-gatherer societies as they were then.</p>
        
        <p>Other than recent archaeological data in paleopathology, barely any careful ethnological observations of pre-contact hunter-gatherers exist outside of the meandering, ethnocentric journals of 18th-century European explorers and missionaries. Contact has always been overwhelmingly destructive for these societies. But even so, the ethnological data of the few surviving contemporary hunter-gatherer groups paint an entirely different picture of our traditional understanding of hunter-gatherers.</p>

<!-- Content Paragraphs -->
<p>
    Our perception of early hunter gatherers societies really only began to change significantly during the mid-half of the 20th century after new research produced by various anthropologists and archeologists, with which the anthropologist Michael Sahlins had synthesised and published as evidence for what he called the The Original Affluent Society, publishing an essay in that name.
</p>

<p>
    In it, he shows that hunter-gatherers were not locked in a desperate struggle for survival; their lives were in fact characterised by affluence. By "affluence," Sahlins refers to the satisfaction of wants, which may be "easily satisfied" either by producing much or desiring little. When we consider wants or desires, the central question becomes: whose desires? The concept of “affluence” simplicter is conceptually incoherent. It is inherently evaluative, and all evaluative terms require contextual indexing. Specifically, they must be tied to the affective cluster of mental states that represent an agent's desires, as well as the means available to fulfil those desires. Any attempt to universalise the concept of affluence—such as equating it solely with material abundance—inevitably smuggles in normative assumptions about which desires (which affective states) matter. This is precisely what early anthropologists did when they projected their bourgeois desires onto hunter-gatherer societies.
</p>

<p>
    It is a descriptive fact that desires can either be limited (finite) or expanded (almost infinitely) through cultural practices. With this in mind, we arrive at the following formulation of affluence:
</p>

<p>
    A society achieves affluence if and only if it can align its culturally defined desires with its available means.
</p>

<p>
    In this framework, we need only show that hunter-gatherer societies achieved affluence by aligning their culturally limited desires with their readily available means, whereas later societies did not. According to Sahlins' topology, there are two models towards affluence:
</p>

<p><strong>Productive Affluence (the Galbraithean model):</strong></p>

<p>
    Affluence arises through the production of goods to meet an ever-expanding set of desires. The pursuit of industrial productivity to fulfil these growing desires creates a cycle of consumption, labour, and production that is inherently unfulfilling. People are enslaved to the process of acquiring more, and, as a result, even in wealthy societies, individuals often feel "poor" in terms of life satisfaction or contentment. Economic progress in this model is seen as the narrowing of the gap between limited means (resources) and unlimited wants (needs and desires). Industrial productivity theoretically makes ever more goods available to satisfy human wants.
</p>

<p>
    Many desires + High consumption rates = Poverty (for most members)
</p>

<p><strong>Zen Affluence (the hunter-gatherer model):</strong></p>

<p>
    The number of material wants is inherently small and finite. The technical means of production remain relatively stable and are sufficiently adequate to meet desires. These desires are easily satisfied because cultural practices have acculturated people to desire less. In this model, the society operates in a state of "abundance" despite having limited material resources, as its members are satisfied with fewer material goods.
</p>

<p>
    Limited desires + Adequate means = Affluence (for most members)
</p>

<p>
    Hunter gatherers are actually far better nourished than most people in the modern world, and certainly, better that civilisations throughout human history (which fare much worse). Hunter gatherer calorie and nutrient consumption met or exceeded the standards of the National Research Council of America. For example, during a four-day observation at Hemple Bay, the mean daily calorie intake was 2,160 per person, while at Fish Creek, it was 2,130 calories over 11 days. The San Bushmen consumed around 2,140 calories per day, which exceeds their estimated requirement of 1,975 calories when adjusted for body weight, activity levels, and population demographics, and the Hadza consumed around 3000 per day. Malnutrition was rare in all cases. And the surplus is not wasted but often goes to dogs. Compare this with the urban poor in many undeveloped nations who consume around 1500 calories per day and where malnutrition is prevalent. A study by Cohen and Armelagos (1984) compared the height and health of pre-agricultural and agricultural populations. They found that pre-agricultural populations, such as the Late Upper Paleolithic European hunter-gatherers, were taller, had better teeth, an were more robust than their agricultural counterparts, and found little signs of disease in skeletal evidence compared to Agrarians.&nbsp;

    Food is abundant and easily accessed in hunter-gatherer societies. The Dobe !Kung Bushmen, despite harsh environmental conditions the year in which anthropologists had visited, where annual rainfall was as low as 6 to 10 inches, they still thrived in a region with abundant vegetation. The mangetti nut often rotted on the ground in surplus. A single individual’s efforts in hunting and gathering could support four to five people. In effect, Bushmen food production was more efficient than French farming prior to World War II, when over 20% of the population was engaged in feeding the rest.

    While the men hunted, the women of the southeastern Australian Aboriginals spend about six hours a day gathering, half of which involved "loitered away in the shade or by the fire". &nbsp;Aboriginals held a preference for making life "as easy as possible" because resources like game and water were readily available: “they can obtain, in two or three hours, a sufficient supply of food for the day”, yet their customary approach is to “roam indolently from spot to spot, lazily collecting it as they wander along”. Observers noted that food was so plentiful that some regions could have supported double the population without scarcity, and a few minutes of fishing could provide enough food for an entire tribe. During the Murray River’s annual inundation, for example, abundant freshwater crayfish sustained hundreds of people for weeks.&nbsp;

    The Hadza people of Africa are just as relaxed in their efficiency. Among the last true hunter-gatherers, they live near Lake Eyasi where resources are plentiful and depend on wild game, honey, and foraged plants. Men often spend dry seasons gambling, even losing their metal-tipped arrows, leaving hunting to a minority, while women gather vegetables at a leisurely pace. Across the year, the average time spent acquiring food is under two hours daily, yet they consistently meet their nutritional needs.

    Hunter-gatherers had a remarkably relaxed approach to labour, working an average of just 2–5 hours a day to meet their subsistence needs. “Foragers,” Sahlins observed, “keep bankers’ hours". This is because their production was driven by immediate needs rather than an endless pursuit of surplus, resulting in a deliberately "erratic" work pattern.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    It's important to note that the conceptual separation of work-leisure was not a thing for them, emically speaking; the very concept of ‘work’, as we contemporaries understand it, is entirely alien to hunter-gatherers (think how some people go hunting and foraging for leisure today). People chattered, sang, ritualised and made art while ‘working’. And there was no boss to report to. Once food and resources were secured, ‘work’ ceased, and time was spent on ‘leisure’, rest, and social activities. This is a culturally instituted decision: the McArthur 1960 study of Australian hunter-gatherers notes that “The quantity of food gathered in one day by any of these groups could in every instance have been increased”, but there's no need for surplus to be appropriated by the boss.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Australian hunter-gatherer women often rested while gathering, and men took days off after successful hunts. "Perhaps they judge what they consider to be enough, and when that is collected they stop." Similarly, Arnhem Landers structured their lives to maximise leisure, with only 65% of the population engaged in food production, and even those spent just 36% of their time on labour. On average, this translated to about 2 hours and 9 minutes of work per day, leaving ample time for crafts, visiting, and relaxation. The Arnhem Landers even invested time in cultivating dietary diversity to avoid monotony and were not satisfied with "a bare existence. Anthropologists found the existence of individuals who were 'full-time craftsmen', but who other than their craft, occasionally exerted themselves in activities like netting fish or gathering bees' nests, but otherwise spent most of their time “talking, eating, and sleeping.”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The Dobe Bushmen demonstrated similar efficiency. Women often gathered enough food in a single day to last three, while men hunted intermittently, sometimes taking weeks off between efforts. Subsistence tasks like cooking or fetching water required just 1–3 hours, freeing up the rest of the day for rest, socialising, and dancing. In short, the economy prioritised sufficiency and quality of life over accumulation. For some hunter-gatherers who had been pushed into areas with extreme climates, they perform lots of work compacted together, followed by lots of rest.

<p><strong>Want Not Lack Not</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    We briefly touched on how hunter-gatherers' low standard of living is culturally and intentionally defined. Indeed, anthropologists found relatively few possessions with them, but they were content with this, in fact, this was a "matter of policy" and not a misfortune: "Want not, lack not" is their credo. It cannot be the case that this was because they were too busy with 'food quests', because anthropologists testify that foraging and hunting was "so successful that half the time the people seem not to know what to do with themselves." They also did not care so much for property, as nomadic movement greatly depreciated property value; the hunters' material wealth quickly becomes a burden. One striking account highlights this disposition:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    “We were humiliated by the realization of how little there was we could give to the Bush­ men. Almost everything seemed likely to make life more difficult for them by adding to the litter and weight of their daily round. They themselves had practically no possessions: a loin strap, a skin blanket and a leather satchel. There was nothing that they could not assemble in one minute, wrap up in their blankets and carry on their shoulders for a journey of a thousand miles. They had no sense of possession.&nbsp;”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Clearly, what was a necessity for these researchers was not so culturally instituted for hunter gatherers. This made them simply lack an interest in developing their technology—as a matter of choice. This is precisely how their are affluent (incidentally, if you have ever met a super-rich individual who has arrived via the Galbraithean road, you might notice similar behaviour of indifference to material possessions). As Sahlins notes, "They have the kind of nonchalance that would be appropriate to a people who have mastered the problems of production."
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Another anthropologist describes the !Kung's indifference to material possessions:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    “The European observer has the impression that these [YahganJ Indians place no value whatever on their utensils and that they have completely forgotten the effort it took to make them. Actually, no one clings to his few goods and chattels which, as it is, are often and easily lost, but just as easily replaced. . . . The Indian does not even exercise care when he could conveniently do so. A European is likely to shake his head at the boundless indifference of these people who drag brand-new objects, precious clothing, fresh provisions, and valuable items through thick mud, or abandon them to their swift destruction by children and dogs. . . . Expensive things that are given them are treasured for a few hours, out of curiousity; after that they thoughtlessly let everything deteriorate in the mud and wet. The less they own, the more comfortable they can travel, and what is ruined they occasionally replace. Hence, they are completely indif­ferent to any material possessions.”
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Prodigality</strong></p>

<p>
    The economic behaviour of hunter-gatherers can be understood as a reaction to their context of abundance. The notion of ‘prodigality’, viz., the immediate consumption of available resources, is indicative of the psychological and cultural disposition that emerges from a society that operates without the constraints of market economies. Without the pressure of scarcity or surplus accumulation, the hunter-gatherers’ behaviour is one of satisfaction, totally unbothered by the cycles of production and consumption that dominate modern life.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The Hadza are a great case in point. They remain surrounded by cultivators in East Africa but have historically refused to adopt farming, citing "too much hard work" as their reason. Their attitude aligns with that of the Bushmen, who famously quip: "Why should we plant, when there are so many mongomongo nuts in the world?" This reluctance stems not from incapacity but from a deliberate preference for leisure and minimal labour. Farming is serious graft, for many hours a day, often in an un-ergonomic posture. Hadza expend less energy and probably less time obtaining food than do their agricultural neighbours. This pattern extends globally. The Yamana people of South America, for instance, frustrated European employers with their "fits and starts" work rhythm, interspersed with long rest periods. What appeared to outsiders as laziness was, in reality, a cultural disposition that valued rest over continuous labor. Sahlins notes this reflects a fundamentally different relationship to work—one that does not equate productivity with virtue.
</p>

<p>
    From the perspective of industrial societies, where labor is endless and scarcity institutionalised, hunter-gatherers’ relaxed approach might seem irresponsible. But this nonchalance toward labour is a product of confidence in the hunter-gatherer economy, rather than evidence of foolishness or imprudence. Therefore, their refusal to embrace agriculture and their seemingly carefree attitude toward labour points to a trust in the success of their subsistence strategies.&nbsp;
