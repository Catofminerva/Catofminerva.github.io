        </figure>
        
        <p>17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes popularised the State of Nature hypothetical construct, in which pre-political humans are framed as selfish, chaotic, and perpetually at war. It’s designed to make the point that, without some central authority, life would descend into total anarchy. From there, it’s a short step away from justifying the need for a powerful, centralised state—the Leviathan—as the only thing standing between humanity and complete disorder.</p>
        
        <p>This idea that hunter-gatherers were by nature violent, inefficient, and clueless likely stems from an early prejudice that evolved with the agricultural revolution. Early foragers-turned-farmers 10,000 years ago, observing that hunter-gatherers neither cultivated fields nor built permanent settlements, probably assumed that these societies were ignorant and incapable of 'properly' doing anything productive with the land. This prejudice fuelled justifications for the dispossession of hunter-gatherers, such as what the Europeans did when they landed on the shores of the New World, as exemplified by the rhetoric of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1823:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>“But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness...”</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>But, as we will see later on, hunter-gatherer groups were not ignorant at all; even when surrounded by farming communities, they actively refused to adopt agriculture because they recognised the vulnerabilities it introduced (e.g., dependence on crop yields, susceptibility to famine) and the benefits they had: less work, more freedom, no lords, no taxes, a more intimate relationship with nature, and more food, and certainly a healthier diet. It’s not as though they failed to grasp basic agricultural principles; understanding that plants grow from seeds under favourable conditions isn’t exactly rocket science (though subsistence farming like large-scale irrigation became much more complicated after the Stone Age). As practically all states eventually found out, the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer to agriculturalists is not easy; it needed significant institutional and cultural shifts such as private property rights and the weakening of egalitarian communal sharing norms to overcome the free-rider problem and incentivise individual labour. Small-scale nomadic hunter-gatherers simply didn’t find these trade-offs worth it. Farming was only a good option if your population is becoming too high for the local environment to support since crops yield far more tons per acre than berries and nuts.</p>
        
        <p>It was also not true that hunter-gatherers inefficiently managed their environments. In many cases, they practiced sophisticated ecological strategies, like ‘firestick burning’, where they intentionally burned vegetation to improve hunting conditions, encourage biodiversity, and manage resources sustainably. This efficiency was simply invisible to agriculturalists who measured productivity in terms of crop yields and surplus.</p>
        
        <p>Nevertheless, agriculture made land more valuable, labour less so, and created the idea of surplus production to protect against annual variation in crop yield. No longer needing a nomadic lifestyle, agrarian settlements expanded and began to tie the legitimacy of land use to its transformation into private property and productive output. This underlying Neolithic prejudice reached its zenith in the economics of Adam Smith, where the development of property and surplus production was central to economic 'progress', and societies that didn’t fit this mould were therefore inherently deficient. Modern bourgeois thought—seen, for instance, in Steven Pinker’s neo-Hobbesian outlook—builds on the same basic prejudice, but now repackages it to fit the capitalist assumptions that production and consumption must be organised around the principle of scarcity (limited resources) and the belief in infinite human wants. From this perspective, it was no wonder that hunter-gatherer societies, which focused on sufficiency and limited desires rather than surplus accumulation, appear hopelessly inadequate.</p>
        
        <p>If we accept the Hobbesian story that's, as I've argued, grounded on the Neolithic prejudice, then we are also accepting the hierarchies, control systems, and coercive structures of the state as unavoidable, even beneficial. But the entire narrative hinges on speculative philosophy about what we believe life was like before the agricultural revolution. Unfortunately, we do not have time machines to travel back 12,000 years ago and observe pre-contact hunter-gatherer societies as they were then.</p>
        
        <p>Other than recent archaeological data in paleopathology, barely any careful ethnological observations of pre-contact hunter-gatherers exist outside of the meandering, ethnocentric journals of 18th-century European explorers and missionaries. Contact has always been overwhelmingly destructive for these societies. But even so, the ethnological data of the few surviving contemporary hunter-gatherer groups paint an entirely different picture of our traditional understanding of hunter-gatherers.</p>

<!-- Content Paragraphs -->
<p>
    Our perception of early hunter gatherers societies really only began to change significantly during the mid-half of the 20th century after new research produced by various anthropologists and archeologists, with which the anthropologist Michael Sahlins had synthesised and published as evidence for what he called the The Original Affluent Society, publishing an essay in that name.
</p>

<p>
    In it, he shows that hunter-gatherers were not locked in a desperate struggle for survival; their lives were in fact characterised by affluence. By "affluence," Sahlins refers to the satisfaction of wants, which may be "easily satisfied" either by producing much or desiring little. When we consider wants or desires, the central question becomes: whose desires? The concept of “affluence” simplicter is conceptually incoherent. It is inherently evaluative, and all evaluative terms require contextual indexing. Specifically, they must be tied to the affective cluster of mental states that represent an agent's desires, as well as the means available to fulfil those desires. Any attempt to universalise the concept of affluence—such as equating it solely with material abundance—inevitably smuggles in normative assumptions about which desires (which affective states) matter. This is precisely what early anthropologists did when they projected their bourgeois desires onto hunter-gatherer societies.
</p>

<p>
    It is a descriptive fact that desires can either be limited (finite) or expanded (almost infinitely) through cultural practices. With this in mind, we arrive at the following formulation of affluence:
</p>

<p>
    A society achieves affluence if and only if it can align its culturally defined desires with its available means.
</p>

<p>
    In this framework, we need only show that hunter-gatherer societies achieved affluence by aligning their culturally limited desires with their readily available means, whereas later societies did not. According to Sahlins' topology, there are two models towards affluence:
</p>

<p><strong>Productive Affluence (the Galbraithean model):</strong></p>

<p>
    Affluence arises through the production of goods to meet an ever-expanding set of desires. The pursuit of industrial productivity to fulfil these growing desires creates a cycle of consumption, labour, and production that is inherently unfulfilling. People are enslaved to the process of acquiring more, and, as a result, even in wealthy societies, individuals often feel "poor" in terms of life satisfaction or contentment. Economic progress in this model is seen as the narrowing of the gap between limited means (resources) and unlimited wants (needs and desires). Industrial productivity theoretically makes ever more goods available to satisfy human wants.
</p>

<p>
    Many desires + High consumption rates = Poverty (for most members)
</p>

<p><strong>Zen Affluence (the hunter-gatherer model):</strong></p>

<p>
    The number of material wants is inherently small and finite. The technical means of production remain relatively stable and are sufficiently adequate to meet desires. These desires are easily satisfied because cultural practices have acculturated people to desire less. In this model, the society operates in a state of "abundance" despite having limited material resources, as its members are satisfied with fewer material goods.
</p>

<p>
    Limited desires + Adequate means = Affluence (for most members)
</p>
