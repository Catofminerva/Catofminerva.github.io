        <h3>Disgrace</h3>
        <img src="disgrace.jpeg" alt="Disgrace cover" style="width: 120px; border: 2px solid #FF33CC; padding: 5px;">
        <p>In post-apartheid South Africa, Lurie, a university lecturer, is disgraced for hooking up with his student. He retreats to the country to live with his daughter. There, they experience her gruelling rape. He turns to working in an "Animal Welfare" clinic whose main role is to kill dogs and cats. He takes it upon himself to incinerate the animals himself, to save them from posthumous humiliation. The book is full of allegories, human emotions and insights on the post-apartheid transitory period and shifting racial power dynamics between whites and blacks who both undergo instances of disgrace.</p>

        <p> Written in 1935, this is an existential novel set during the Great Depression. Gloria Beatty and her boyfriend particpate in a gruelling and long dance marathon contest that drags for weeks, all to win the $1000 prize money or be noticed by studio producers and movie stars. At one point, Gloria asks ”Why are these high-powered scientists always screwing around trying to prolong life instead of finding pleasant ways to end it?”. The novel ends with one of the most bleak questions in all of literature, which is the title of the book. It is meant to depict the helplessness people felt during the Depression, who worked really hard in a rat-race marathon to the top but ended up nowhere.</p>

        <p>800-page memoirs of the 19th century Russian intellectual and revolutionary, Alexander Herzen. It is deeply personable, vibrant with life and history. I have read dozens of memoirs and autobiographies, this one is a literary masterpiece.</p>

        <p>Diary written by Sebastian Haffner, a young German Jew, as he watches his country descend into Nazism. The litereary style and writing is particularly brilliant.</p>

        <h3>Available Light: Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics.</h3>
        <img src="geertz.jpg" alt="Geertz" style="width: 120px; border: 2px solid #FF33CC; padding: 5px;">
        <p>But Clifford Geertz doing philosophy, what's not to like? Philosophy of anthropology, anthropology of philosophy? Being a work of *reflection*, Clifford isn’t afraid of going on tangents. Im hesitant to recommend this because a lot of background knolwedge is needed to appreaciate some of the essays. But the literary style makes it accessible to most people.</p>

        <h3>Russian Thinkers</h3>

        <p>Fascinating inights into 19th century Russian Intelligentsia. Was particularly amused on how many of them used literature as a tool for liberation, as the only medium available to them for social criticism. Isaiah Berlin, the writer, does a profoundly good job at making such a dense subject extremely entertaining.</p>

        <h3>Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America</h3>
        <img src="left.jpg" alt="Book cover" style="width: 120px; border: 2px solid #FF33CC; padding: 5px;">
        <p>Achieving Our Country is a series of lectures delivered by American Pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty in 1997, in which he reflects on American Leftism in the past century. Rorty laments the state of the American Left of his time and its apparent abandonment of early Leftist ideals pertaining to hope and patriotism, which, he says, have been substituted by excessive and abstract theorising, self-hatred, and resigned nihilism. He contends that the academic Left has turned its back on "real leftist politics" to indulge in esoteric cultural and identity pursuits from the comfort of their ivory towers, content with passively condemning "the system," "capitalism," "neoliberalism," and "neocolonialism," rather than proposing tangible, specific social policies to alleviate human suffering. Throughout these intellectually stimulating lectures, Rorty nostalgically revisits what he refers to as "the old reformist Left"—a patriotic American Left inspired by the likes of John Dewey and Walt Whitman, espousing a rhetoric of commonality and communitarianism rather than merely respecting and recognising identity differences. This Left admits the constructive nature of national identity while acknowledging and espousing its ability for solidarity and as a basis to appeal to for justice (“fellow Americans”). This is an America where people of diverse backgrounds come together to forge a unified culture that transcends its individual components. Though there exists another, darker narrative of America—one founded on bloodshed and brutality, and Rorty concedes that both accounts are historically accurate, but he argues that dwelling on the latter with self-disgust is a vestige of the theological concept of 'sin.' He suggests that we view these past heinous acts as failures of imagination by previous generations, who operated within a historically defined framework of justice. The slave trade, the massacre of Native Americans, and foreign wars exemplify this framework's shortcomings, as the America that institutionalised lynching failed to uphold its proclaimed ideals of liberty and equality. Yet, Rorty posits that ‘America’ is an open-ended project, a work in progress. While our forebears (previous participants in this project) failed to empathise with and walk in the shoes of disenfranchised women, slaves, Vietnamese children, and others, condemning this ongoing endeavour as irredeemably wicked only leads to the stagnation of the project. This mindset, prevalent today in what Rorty calls ‘the cultural left’, fosters a milieu of passive observation, theorising, and castigation, with the misguided hope that the project will one day be torn asunder, by a bloody revolution if need be, and start afresh with a blank page.</p>
