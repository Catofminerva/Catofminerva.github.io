<h3>All Entries <span class="blink">â˜…</span></h3>

<p> there's still a lot of formatting issues in the posts, many images nor rendering etc. also some of these posts have been written ages ago. some of my views have changed to become more radical, others have tempered down, etc. though many posts are disjointed string of ideas formed in a stream of consciousness, the worst of that kind i refrained from uploading at all :)</p>

<ul class="entries">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <time class="date-badge" datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">
        {{ post.date | date: "%d/%m/%Y" }}
      </time>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<style>
  .date-badge{
    margin-left:8px;
    font-size:12px;
    color: var(--neon-yellow, #ffff33);
    white-space: nowrap;
    vertical-align: baseline;
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
</style>
