In Qatar, certain individuals, such as members of specific tribes, those from particular family backgrounds, or even native-born non-citizens, often experience their own forms of unique marginalisation that are not felt by transient migrants (labourers and Westerners). These individuals may be perceived as perpetual outsiders, trailing behind the social hierarchy of "real locals."</p><p>This hierarchy is not only deeply ingrained in Qatari society but is also codified in its laws. It is worth investigating how these marginalised groups, or the local sub-subalterns, navigate and perform their Qatariness in an attempt to assimilate into the idealised prototype Qatari identity and blend into the mainstream. Additionally, it is important to consider whether these individuals feel alienated or insecure due to their status as "insider-outsiders" in the presence of more dominant Qatari social groups.</p><p>In this sense, while the entire identification category ‘Qatari’ is perceived to be under ontological threat (due perhaps to the lack of determinacy in continuously oscillating between traditionalism and modernism, or because of a perceived threat of the dilution of a sense-making framework (nationalism) by external forces (globalisation, western acculturation) or because of a permanent insecurity inherent in being a minority in ones own country), this anxiety is doubly and constantly felt by these groups as a result of their more precarious position—a sort of meta-insecurity, insecurity about identifying with an insecure interpretive framework.</p><p>Also, the analysis need not be limited to tribe or citizenship-based groupings. Many long-term residents of Qatar, including those born and raised in the country, often grapple with their own identity crises as they strive to align themselves with the elusive Qatari archetype. This abstract benchmark serves as both a measure by which individuals assess themselves and a point of reference for structuring their lives.</p><p>To successfully 'pass' as Qatari is to attain similar privileges, rewards, and social acceptance while managing the stigma of being perceived as an 'other.' Goffman's work on stigma, or 'Aib,' is particularly relevant in this context. </p><p>Individuals may modify various aspects of their presentation, such as their accent, vocabulary, attire, and grooming habits, in an attempt to be perceived as “authentic” Qatari citizens.</p><p>However, subtle markers, including dialect imperfections, family names, or skin complexion, can still betray their efforts and reveal their 'otherness'. Those who are unconditionally accepted as part of the nation are positioned in relation to these 'visible' others. By excluding these otherwise suspect groups, a tacit national framework is employed to assert access to key material and ontological resources, or national-cultural capital. This exclusionary process serves to reinforce the dominant group's status while maintaining the boundaries that separate the 'genuine' Qataris from those perceived as outsiders.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Eternal Palestinian Wanderer</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg" width="640" height="423" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:423,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:54531,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21003b7b-6b9d-4184-91cb-3f253460ef37_640x423.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Jeff Huysmans' (1998) notion of ontological security serves as a powerful lens to illuminate the process through which meaning is forged and sustained through identity exclusion and inclusion. Huysman invokes George Simmel’s (1908) Simmelian “stranger”—an enigmatic entity that is neither friend nor foe, insider nor outsider, part of the self nor part of the other. A presence transcending the realms of categorisation, cloaked in the mystique of strangeness.</p><p>The stranger is not an outsider or a newcomer but someone who is both within and outside a group simultaneously, poised between familiarity and foreignness, intimacy and distance. She is part of the group but remains detached, maintaining a certain distance from the group's core members.</p><p>In being in this state of limbo, she emerges as a spectre haunting the notion of, not only a bounded identity, but of ontological security—the sense of biographical stability, consistency, and continuity in an individual's or a collective's experiences and self-identity. It is the psychological assurance that comes from having a coherent and predictable narrative of the world and one's place within it. The stranger dissolves ontological security by echoing indeterminacy and chaos out of the very potential of order, the very potential of creating clear dichotomies and borders. </p><p>Born in Qatar's embrace, the Palestinian resident is the modern archetype of the Simmelian stranger, the embodiment of a national paradox—non-national national, member of a nation without a nation. She wanders the world as a universal stranger, a perpetual exile, her life a testament to the contradiction of belonging and unbelonging, intimately tied to a homeland that exists only in the realm of memory and longing. Not a visitor from a distant land, for there no longer exists 'another land' to call her own—no place to rest her weary heart, free from the mantle of visitor or stranger. </p><p>This Palestinian condition of liminality exemplifies the modern paradox of statelessness; people devoid of their own territorial roots and yet are the quintessence of rootedness. The Palestinian today is an ethereal phantom of custom, roaming adrift in a time marked by inflexible borders and unwavering national principles—echoes of a migratory history within an epoch of permanence and settlement. At the periphery of Qatari society, she resides—unclaimed by Qatar or any other nation, as the concept of ‘nationhood’ is traditionally understood.</p><p>In the heart of Qatar, where nationhood serves as an ontological quilt, the Palestinian may find herself woven into a nation of her own—yet a nation unmoored and without a home. Stranger she remains, as her attempts to blend in leaves her distinguishable still—by the curve of her smiles, the cadence of her speech, and the subtleties of her demeanour.</p><p>For the hosts, her spectral presence, her strong Arabic roots and similarity, weaves a thread of uncertainty through the intricate pattern of nationhood, challenging not only the established order but also the very possibility of neatly categorising individuals into ‘us and them’. Neither wholly in nor out, she lingers in the interstice, blurring the lines between friend and foe—the lines which form the very essence of the refied nation-state's mythological illusion of boundedness, definitiveness, and substantialness, and thus calling into question the very believability of the myth.</p><p>As this challenge to ontological security unfolds, it becomes an exploration of the nature of being itself—in this case, national identity—without allowing the former to be subsumed by the latter. In the shadows of the Qatari landscape, the Palestinians' story unfurls, a poignant testament to the complexities and constraints that encircle the notions of nationhood and identity, ultimately questioning the very foundations of an “authentic” Qatari identity within the nation-state's embrace.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Elusive Yardstick for Passing as the Genuine Article</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg" width="750" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:81713,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1889c45c-8f68-4fa1-ae37-60f85d79b27c_750x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The national team.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The essentialist myth of a bounded Qatari identity is often differentiated into two groups: authentic Qataris (قطريين اصليين), which comprise of several Arab tribes, and inauthentic Qataris (غير اصلين), consisting of naturalised nationals, families and tribes with non-Arab origins (such as Balochis, Persians, Africans, Yemenis, Egyptians, etc.) and Shia families. Thus, within the national space of 'Qatar,' there exist both distinct and indistinct categories, each defined by the amount of national cultural capital they possess based on invented taxonomies (Hage 1998:54). A combination of discernible features, such as dialect and skin colour, and not immediately discernible features (family name, tribe and other genealogical histories) ultimately determines who is granted entry into the exclusive circle of the former category, illustrating that the use of prejudicial categories must be understood within a very parochial national context.</p><p>The case of naturalised citizens is particularly intriguing, especially when examining the contrasting treatment of naturalised athletes like Faris Hassouna and Moataz Barshim. Despite winning gold medals for Qatar and being native-born residents who were subsequently naturalised, they are nonetheless barred from participating in the Shura Council election as voters or candidates. On one hand, they are celebrated as national heroes when it benefits the privileged population; on the other hand, they are relegated to the status of 'others' when it does not (as when the national team loses a game). This division is enshrined in Law No. 2 of 1961, highlighting the complexities and contradictions that underlie the concept of national identity in Qatar.</p><p>In some instances, individuals from non-passing groups may resort to concealing or misrepresenting their family names (for example, families like Al-Ahmad, Al-Abdullah, etc., which could denote either a prestigious, ethnically-Arab tribe or a variation often associated with an ethnically-Persian family or former slave descendants of the original tribe) to minimise stigma and pass as Qataris. This underscores the dual need for recognition and belonging, as any claim to membership in a particular in-group identity relies on others acknowledging the claimants as 'passing.'</p><p>The groups in question encompass not only other nationalities born and raised among Qataris but also de facto Qatari citizens from subaltern tribes or racial backgrounds, such as Balochis or individuals of African descent. These individuals may be perceived as second-class citizens in terms of social and political capital, even when they are materially well-off. However, these locally-born, “would-be” Qataris or residents do not merely assimilate passively into the dominant archetype. By virtue of their perceived or invented difference, they simultaneously modify it and engage in a power struggle over the native society's classification of who may be considered a national. They, therefore, more than constitute it and are constituted by it.</p><p>Furthermore, they influence perceptions of how native-born immigrants and naturalised de facto Qataris, who may still be considered 'others,' ought to behave in order to qualify as members of the nation and demonstrate their 'Qatariness' despite their heritage, tribe, or race. This ongoing negotiation highlights the fluidity and complexity of national identity and belonging within the Qatari context.</p><p>Again I am here proposing research questions not conclusion, so please excuse the disjointedness and vagueness of the entry.  </p>
