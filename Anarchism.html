<p>So, Ibn Saud (the dude who would eventually found modern Saudi Arabia) had a bit of a problem on his hands. He needed to turn a bunch of rebellious, heretical, nomadic Bedouins into a reliable military force to erect the second Saudi state and take back land from the Ottomans. So he sent a bunch of religious preachers out to convince the Bedouins that their way of life—AKA nomadism—was against Islam. Which, to be fair, is kinda true considering bedouins were always known to be super chill about religion, still largely practicing polytheism and blending traditional pre-Islamic beliefs with Islam. They were definitely seen as 'heretical' by the standards of the Wahhabi orthodoxy Ibn Saud was trying to enforce.</p>

<p>But Ibn Saud didn’t care about any of that, he needed an army. They were forced to sell their camels, which was a huge deal because camels were their livelihood as nomadic pastoralists, given houses and land, and paid to live in fixed settlements. And—because they were divided into clans in various locations, not full tribes—he essentially de-tribalised them, breaking down their traditional social structures. Genius move. And it actually worked… for a while.</p>

<p>Now Ibn Saud had finally built this hyper-religious, ultra-zealous military force called the ‘Ikhwan’, and they were going to take back Najd and the Hejaz from the Ottomans. They wore distinctive white headbands at all times and were more than willing to go to war whenever the "waly amr" (or leader) called upon them.</p>

<p>But… that eventually became the issue. They weren't full-time soldiers. You now have this extremely fanatic, extremely large, by far the largest population in the state, basically doing nothing productive at times of peace, and the Saudi state was footing the bill for all of them. The new state system took away their former autonomy and mobility and made them totally dependent on the state for survival. It forced them to become religious, settled them, gave them a new identity, conscripted them, and now wants them to become a productive class of capitalists. But the Ikhwan weren't having it; they shunned agriculture, trade, and industrial labor as "heretical" and incompatible with the purity of islam. Instead, they turned their state-given settlements into mosques and spent their days praying and contributing nothing ‘productive’ to the state. Anything not directly tied to religious purity or Jihad was ipso facto “heretical”.</p>

<p>And to make matters worse, they started to loot and kill other bedouins because they weren't "orthodox" enough. The state had created a new class of human beings through the tools of sedentarisation, religious indoctrination, and dependency and called them the Ikhwan. But once that classification was created, it had a life of its own. The category looped back on the state, and the people so defined by their hyper-orthodox identity destabilised the very project of state-building that had given rise to them in the first place. That’s a textbook example of what philosopher Ian Hacking called the ‘feedback loop’: once specific categories are applied to human beings, the categories don't stay static but “loops back” and shape both the people so named and the society that named them.</p>

<p>One can picture Ibn Saud in a Vader robe “How dare you disobey your Creator!!”. So, the state had to send in a new batch of preachers to preach about the virtue of productivity, how it's very much aligned with Islamic teaching, and issued a fatwa that says that the bedouins, who had previously been considered "heretical", were now considered Muslims after all, so the Ikhwan had no right killing them. Pretty convenient now. The state eventually got what it needed: more compliance, more productivity, and less anarchism.</p>

<p>anyway, this is why i'm an anarchist.</p>
