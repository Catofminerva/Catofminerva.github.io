<p><span style="font-size:18px">Once upon a time before his election, George W. &ldquo;Dubya&rdquo; Bush, self-styled leader of the Free World, had a little chat with a televangelist, claiming that he thought &quot;God wants me to run for president&quot;. As if The Big Guy Upstairs had a divine interest in American politics. With divine approval in his pocket, Bush was elected, and the nation experienced a faith-infused presidency. The Holy Spirit had RSVP&#39;d &quot;yes&quot; to the White House shindig, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Bush, a born-again Christian, basically turned the White House into a holy clubhouse. Together, they brewed a variety of faith-based policies. There were the so-called &quot;faith-based initiatives,&quot; where federal aid was funneled into church groups for social services (because when Jesus said &quot;feed my sheep,&quot; he obviously meant with taxpayer dollars, a divine slice of the federal budget). And, of course, there were the &quot;abstinence-only&quot; school programs; Nothing channels the Almighty like trying to rein in teenage hormones with heavenly mandates! The Bush administration also pushed for teaching &quot;intelligent design,&quot; which one might argue was an &quot;intelligently designed&quot; way of sneaking creationism into schools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Then came September 11, 2001, when Al Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The theology of the Bush administration transformed into a crusade-like mentality. The &quot;War on Terror&quot; became the latest rendition of the biblical blockbuster, &quot;Good vs. Evil: The Ultimate Showdown.&quot; Here, where holy wrath mingled with jingoistic nationalism, the abuse and torture of Muslim detainees in Guantanamo Bay took on an air of divine retribution. To Bush and his neocon evangelists, nothing says &quot;blessed are the peacemakers&quot; like a little waterboarding, right?</span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size:18px">The Prophecy of Gag and Magog in Iraq</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">But the biggest blunder perhaps came in January 2003, right before the attack on Iraq. Recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23923114">evidence</a>&nbsp;suggests that the US war in Iraq was launched in part because Bush, a committed evangelist, believed he was fulfilling a biblical prophecy.&nbsp;Now, picture the scene: George Dubya Bush, with the nuclear football at arm&#39;s length, suddenly goes full Nostradamus in the Oval Office, bellowing obscure biblical prophecies like a rogue street preacher.&nbsp;At the time,&nbsp;Bush was trying to charm foreign dignitaries into joining his crusade in Iraq&mdash;most notably, France&#39;s then-president, Jacques Chirac. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">During the meeting with Chirac, Bush started ranting about obscure biblical passages concerning the prophecy of Gog and Magog: &ldquo;Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East, Biblical prophecies are being fulfilled. This confrontation is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people&#39;s enemies before a new age begins&rdquo; he babbled to a bewildered French president.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Confused about what the American commander in-chief, now a raving lunatic, was saying, and probably contemplating whether he had stumbled into a rejected &quot;X-Files&quot; episode,&nbsp;Chirac reached out to theologian Thomas R&ouml;mer to translate Bush&#39;s&nbsp;apocalyptic ramble.&nbsp;R&ouml;mer explained that Gog and Magog is an apocalyptic prophecy written about in two obscure chapters of Ezekiel, which describe a battle involving a global coalition of nations that will attack Israel. The prophecy is that Gog,&nbsp;of the land of Magog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal, will lead many nations coming in from the North (supposedly&nbsp;Iraq) to attack Israel and will end with his defeat by the wrath of God.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Interestingly, Ronald Reagan also embraced this prophecy, albeit with Russia playing the role of Gog. And so, the stage was set for a war of biblical proportions, driven by a misguided belief in ancient prophecies and their eerie echoes in the modern world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Reagan was once&nbsp;<a href="https://joelrosenberg.com/ezekiel/you-wrote-in-the-ezekiel-option-that-ronald-reagan-was-fascinated-with-the-coming-war-of-gog-and-magog-is-that-really-true/">quoted</a>&nbsp;saying:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">In the thirty-eighth chapter of Ezekiel it says God will take the children of Israel from among the heathen [where] they&rsquo;d been scattered and will gather them again in the promised land. Ezekiel says that . . . the nation that will lead all the other powers into darkness against Israel will come out of the north. What other powerful nation is to the north of Israel [besides Russia]? None. But it didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense before the Russian revolution, when Russia was a Christian country. Now it does, now that Russia has become communistic and atheistic, now that Russia has set itself against God. Now it fits the description perfectly.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Thus, we find ourselves spectators in the absurdity of US politics, where a world leader&mdash;complete with nuclear codes and a military juggernaut&mdash;becomes the leading man in an Old Testament prophecy.&nbsp;As if the reality TV spectacle that was the Trump presidency hadn&#39;t already set the bar high enough for political,&nbsp;along comes Dubya&mdash;half knight-errant, half preacher, clutching the nuclear codes in one hand and the Holy Bible in the other&mdash;dead set on fulfilling an ancient biblical script to save us all from the mythical Gog and Magog.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">If we look back at this episode with a chuckle, it&#39;s perhaps to stifle the involuntary tingles making their way down our spines. W</span><span style="font-size:18px">hen the final curtain falls on the tragicomedy that is US politics, we&#39;re left with a bracing reality check about the continous potency of religious zealousy. So here&#39;s to George W. Bush, the divinely inspired warlord, whose holy mission to eradicate evil managed to scribble a new, bewildering footnote in the chapters of human absurdity.</span>​​​​​​​</p>
