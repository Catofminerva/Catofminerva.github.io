The initiator of this movement, one Mohammed Ibn Abdul-Wahab (transliterally: the ‘the son of the servant of the Bestower’), along with a handful of followers, embarked on their mission in Najd, Central Arabia. During that time, most of the Arab population nominally identified as Muslims but were as liberal, bountiful, pluralistic, pantheistic—not to say polytheistic, in their religious practices as anyone else. Some revered the graves of holy men, other pledged themselves to trees in the vicinity of these tombs, others called upon local demigods and spirits, and others more were entirely unreligious in the sense of not adhering to an organised religious system. </p><p>This resurgence of forms of ‘paganism’ mirrored the very same beliefs that the Islamic prophet Muhammad had ostensibly fought against and that the Quran sought to eradicate. The Quran, by asserting the unity of a god, mandates worship, self-abnegation and supplication to one god alone. Armed with this idea and driven by the fervour of a reformer and the vigour of a revivalist, Ibn Abdul-Wahab endeavoured, through both words and sword, to steer the Arabs back to the unadulterated, monotone and standardised essence of Islam, as he took it to be, and its Unitarian doctrine.</p><p>That, as far as I know, not a single <em>critical</em> biography has been written on arguably the most controversial figure in the Arab world whose ideas have permeated the fabrics of our—meaning we Gulf peoples—social and religious life to this day, is a baffling lacuna and shows clearly the general lack of interest afforded to premodern Oriental thinkers by historians of ideas of the academic sort. A few extant biographies consist almost entirely of praise and idolatry written by devout disciples and Wahhabi apologists (most of which remain primary sources untranslated from Arabic). What is needed is a critical and systematic study of Ibn Abdulwahab’s life such that we are more able to understand the mind of the progenitor one of the world’s most puritanical creeds. </p><p>Such an endeavour is made more difficult by the lack of impartial historic archives to reference and the few fragmentary descriptions noted down by the chroniclers of Ibn Abdulwahab’s period, who themselves were often his disciples. Early sources from the Orientalist Gifford Palgrave and Dr. David Commins’ work on the doctrine of Wahhabism comes to mind as the closest to achieve this goal I have put forth. </p><p>Nevertheless, much remains omitted in terms of a biographical account of his life and influence and not merely the ‘idea’ of Wahhabism as it evolved. That is to say, no hitherto attempt to delve deep into the mind of this otherwise obscure shadowy figure of the 18th century who apparently possessed the most considerable influence upon Gulf thought and religion has yet been given. A man who has almost single handedly led an intellectually conservative revolution back to the dark ages.</p><p>This essay, although by no means meant to be a comprehensive biography, nevertheless seeks to fill this void to some minuscule extent insofar as a critical view goes. Doing so, I believe, will shed some light, perhaps a drop in the ocean, on the presuppositions that embody many actions and thoughts of current Gulf society, notably those in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries, as well as the roots of the socio-religious conservatism that continues to pervade the region.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Idolatry, Paganism and Folk Religions in Arabia and the Greater Orient during Ibn Abdulwahab's Time</h2><p>The history of all monotheistic faiths seems to adhere closely to a consistent pattern: an innate propensity draws individuals toward idolatrous veneration, and only through divine mercy are they able to overcome such inclinations, seek forgiveness for their transgressions, and continue their arduous spiritual journey in the comfortable palms of monotheism. The children of Israel, the Romans, and the Arabs all succumbed to this apparent predilection, and it is only through the guidance of sagacious figures, some divinely inspired, who rescue the tribe from the hideous jaws of polytheism. Ibn Abdulwahab was said to be one such figure.</p><p>Before we delve into Ibn Abdulwahab’s life, we will start, as we always love to do in this blog, with digressions. It is important to first acknowledge the difficulty in discerning the historical accuracy of any accounts of pre-modern Arabia. Following the advent of Islam, historical and philosophical research was subordinated to the study of the <em>hadith</em> (Muhammed’s words and deeds) as science par excellence. All intellectual currents were invariably Islamic through and through, and so narrations of the past were taken over and controlled by that dominant lens. People were discouraged from studying the days of the <em>Jahiliya</em> (the pre-Islamic era), the name given to that era itself translates into ‘the Age of Ignorance’ and bears witness to the historical bias and revisionism that occurred. I also beg the reader to imagine the scorn and retribution with which a scholar would be met with if she had described the paganism of that time with any sort of praise or even in neutral tones. And so pre-Islamic history was treated by Muslim historians (with the exception of Ibn Al Kalbi, who indeed was met with contempt by his milieu and was fiercely attacked by traditionalists, the likes of Al-Baghdädi and al-Dhahabi, for his study of pre-Islamic paganism from poems and chronicles) in a cursory manner and much of the focus remained (and remains) on Islamic eras.</p><p>The same can equally be said about the pre-Wahhabism era of the 18th century. Nevertheless, a history we shall endeavour on giving. In the epoch of Ibn Abdulwahab, the land of Arabia and the expansive Middle East experienced a remarkable measure of pluralism in matters both religious and societal. This era, preceding the relentless dissemination of Ibn Abdulwahab's puritanical dogma, was characterised by an atmosphere of comparative tolerance and intellectual multiplicity.</p><p>In the sphere of Islamic jurisprudence, the four cardinal Sunni schools of thought—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali—thrived, with erudite men engaging in spirited disputation and discourse on the interpretation and execution of Islamic law (Hourani, 1891). These exchanges fostered an environment wherein a plurality of opinions was not merely sanctioned but heartily encouraged, thus engendering a dynamic intellectual landscape.</p><p>Sufism, an esoteric and mystical branch of Islam, enjoyed considerable popularity in the region during this age before being rendered unislamic (Lings, 1893). Sufi orders emphasised the import of love, compassion, and spiritual unity, fostering an atmosphere of tolerance and inclusivity. The veneration of saints and pilgrimages to their sepulchres were widely practiced by followers of Sufism, reflecting the more pluralistic and liberal approach to religious observance prevalent in that time. </p><p>Ibn Ghannam (1810), a contemporary chronicler of the burgeoning Wahhabi movement, portrayed the religious climate in Arabia during the time of Muhammad ibn Abdulwahab—who he considered to be a marvellous reformist—in what we are supposed to accept as being bleak tones. We are informed that the veneration of stones, sacred trees, local demigods and deities rooted in the pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism and the graves of saints was widespread with supplicants either beseeching the saints and demigods directly or soliciting their intercession with God, and that all this we ought to take as being a degeneration of previous states of affairs. His account has since become the standard description of pre-Wahhabi Arabia, with Saudi scholars extolling Ibn Abdulwahab's aim of reviving the pristine faith by adhering to the traditions of the pious forebears and the teachings of the Qur'an and Hadith.</p><p>Though almost every inhabitant of Arabia, be they settled or nomadic, did indeed believe in a the God of Mohammed pre-Wahhabism, and were nominally Muslim, but amongst the nomadic, particularly those tending to camels, their practices did not mirror Muslim practices of new; their worship bear a striking resemblance to the Old Testament Patriarchs' faith. They possess no sacred sites, no objects, nor intermediaries between humankind and Allah, nor do they engage in formal prayers. In short, they were Muslim in name alone, scarcely adhering to Islamic tenets. Conversely, the settled folk and townspeople residing in various communities did maintain their own sacred spaces which Ibn Ghannam describes, such as venerated trees, stones, and springs, where they offered prayers and revered the deceased as their protectors and constructed monuments of varying magnitudes in their honour. </p><p>Bleakness is, of course, a relative concept. There is, to my mind, something beautiful about the indigenous folk religions of the time. Tribes and communities did indeed, as Ibn Ghannam narrates, continue to hold on to their pre-Islamic ancestral beliefs and customs even after the spread of Islam, and had habitually invoked local demigods or ancestral spirits associated with specific locations, such as trees, stones, or caves who all played meaningful roles in their lives in a world that exhibited a kind of sentient ecology of interacting ontologies in which humans were just on part of (see: ‘animism’, a precursor to some postmodern theories on ontology). The fundamental difference between these demigods and Allah was that the former were <em>immanent</em> i.e. co-present with humans and existed in the realm of human affairs, while the latter is considered <em>transcendent</em>, existing “out there”, independent of human needs and desires. </p><p>While there is very little known about these specific local demigods, anthropologists have long observed the invocations of “metapersons” in folk religions to empower humans in all manners of daily social activities such as gardening, hunting, warfare, trading, lovemaking, curing illnesses, cooking food and so on. As renowned anthropologist Michael Sahlins (2022) notes “this engagement of metahuman power is an all-around cultural praxis: meaning, the implication of spiritual powers is the condition of the possibility of human social activities of every kind”. </p><p>Of course the same can, in principle if not in practice, be stated about the invocation of a single entity like Allah; but the upshot of the matter is that a plurality of demigods each having a specific role in human affairs, serving specific human functions in human activities, are infinitely more concrete and pragmatic, infinitely more to do with actual living human beings and their practical concerns as opposed to the vast shadowy, capricious, moralistic, hierarchy-obsessed, metaphysically abstract, ineffable and incommunicable God who abandoned earth and is divorced from human needs and interests, solely concerned with being worshipped for His own sake and issuing salvations and damnations upon individuals. This sovereign patriarch standing over and above lowly human affairs and relations, loving nothing more than being obeyed willy nilly, is the god of the missionaries which these peoples held no real interest in. </p><p>Arabian folk deities on the other hand were distinctly human (sometimes female, sometimes bisexual), they served distinct human desires, interests and needs, such as the need to exploit nature, and consequently their inventiveness were infinitely more imaginative and superior than the absolutist and authoritative words vouchsafed in a sacred text of supernatural origin or through the medium of other, supposedly more wiser, men, who themselves held their own independent or theological or otherworldly interests. I say “otherworldly” because folk tribes did not ruminate too much about another world of a different constitution precisely because spirits, be they corporeal or immaterial (after all humans too were considered spirits with an incorporeal soul—just of a different kind), were in the end terrestrial, earthly and participated in human life; thus no distinction between the natural and supernatural was ever invoked (and this is not too unlike the fact that we contemporaries talk about institutions, states, monetary systems as reified agents, and of corporations as persons with legal rights). And though they believed, when they cared to believe, in the immortality of the soul, this does not mean the existence of the individual as such, as the continuation of identity post-death, but rather it is the existence of the ‘soul’ itself, whether reincarnated as a human being or another embodied spirit.</p><p>In Heideggerian terms, folk peoples epistemological credo was that ‘Being is being there’, in that, far from being ‘mere superstitious’ thinkers, they were proto-empiricists and their gods did not exist in a different realm of existence but were dependent for their ontology on human experience. Or put somewhat crudely, because humans are not self-sufficient, spirits of the dead, ancestors, and demigods were unexplained causal agents who played the role of invisible peers and helped in myriad daily functions, not least in controlling and predicting nature.</p><p>As anthropologist Stanley Walens astutely puts it, indigenous demigods were “as practical and mechanical as techniques of wood-carving or fishing . . . No matter how skilled a woodcarver is, his carving will be excellent only insofar as he is helped by the spirits and their power to carve; the fisher-man, no matter how carefully he has constructed his weir, is doomed to failure unless he can invoke spirit-power to make the salmon come to the place where he is fishing” (Walens 1981). </p><p>These spirits and demigods were moreover less capricious because they are, by their very nature, always doing exactly what those who call upon them are also doing; their agency is reducible to human agency and experience, and divinity is a mere mirror of what actually instantiates on the ground: the land is more or less fertile, the crop grows or does not, the fish are caught or are not, women bear healthy children or they do not etc.</p><p>Also, they were, like the gods in Game of Thrones, more stylish, chic and sophisticatedly constructed, just take a glimpse at these pre-Islamic goddesses:</p><div

The ancient deities, such as Allat, Al Uzah, and Al Manat, whom Mohammed initially referred to as "the exalted women, whose intercession is hoped for" during his first recitation of the Quranic chapter An-Najm, were subsequently renounced, and the verses were later alleged by Mohammad as having been ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_Verses#Basic_narrative">satanic verses</a>’ mistaken for divine revelation.  (A once universally accepted incident which had later undergone historical revisionism and rendered fabricated to fit the orthodoxy of an infallible prophet). These, along with a multitude of lesser local demigods, subsequently relinquished their place to Allah, the paramount deity and sole remnant of the Meccan pantheon. </p><p>However, the lingering influence of these bygone gods persisted even though some tribes eventually shifted their devotion from their individual local deities to the veneration of a single patron saint. The ingrained local customs and rites were so deeply interwoven into the societal fabric that even Mohammed felt obliged to largely maintain the status quo, reluctant not to throw the baby with the bath water and merely prohibiting a handful of the most egregious violations. Hence practices such as the Hajj pilgrimages’ visitation of the sacred mountains of <em>Safa</em> and <em>Merwa</em> who were two cherished idols. Hence the pre-Islamic tradition where <em>Quraysh</em> (the dominant tribe during Muhammed’s time) chanted the following verses as they circumambulated the Kaaba:</p><blockquote><p>By al-Lat and al-'Uzza,<br>And Manat, the third idol besides.<br>Verily they are the most exalted females<br>Whose intercession is to be sought.  </p></blockquote><p>Hence, too, the tradition of hurling stones at the devil in the vale of Mina, the sacrifices of animals on the vale, the vigil (<em>al-waquf</em>) on ‘Arafah’ and <em>Al-Muzdalafah</em>,  and the festivities on the new moon. These were all pre-Islamic pagan rituals that traces all the way back to Abraham, and which presently remain unaltered as the iconoclastic prophet did not wish to volunteer too much in disintegrating, having been <a href="https://answering-islam.org/Books/Al-Kalbi/uzza.htm">quoted</a> as saying "I have offered a white sheep to al-'Uzza, while I was a follower of the religion of my people" according to ibn al-Kalbi. One of Muhammed’s arch nemesis, Abu Lahab, who the author of the Quran, the Lord of the Cosmos, devoted an entire chapter claiming how much he will burn in hellfire for eternity for the most pettiest of reasons (i.e. being annoyed and saying “Muhammad promises me things which I do not see” after Muhammed rendezvoused all the tribes under the guise that an attack was eminent just to start proselytising to them), was also actually named Abd Al-‘Uzzah (slave of Al-‘Uzzah).</p><p>Though it scarcely ever occurred to the regional Arabs to stop prostrating themselves to something nonhuman altogether (with the exception of avant-garde figures like al-Ma'arri) and focus on their commitment to one another, what was nonetheless common among many of both the nomadic and settled is that Allah was one more deity among the pantheon (hence Mohammed’s fathers’ name ‘Abdullah’ ‘the slave of Allah’ and where others were named abdul-[name of a god], and also the Quranic verse: “And most of them believe not in God, without also associating other deities with Him“, Sûrah XII :106). Even if he may be more powerful, had larger muscles than the local demigods, he was full of abstract attributes; all in all, omnipotence, holiness, absoluteness, infinity, omniscience and the like, and consequently, held no real practical use. Pragmatist philosopher William James (1902) describes this in his <em>Varieties</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Theism, whenever it has erected itself into a systematic philosophy of the universe, has shown a reluctance to let God be anything less than All-in-All. In other words, philosophic theism has always shown a tendency to become pantheistic and monistic, and to consider the world as one unit of absolute fact; and this has been at variance with popular or practical theism, which latter has ever been more or less frankly pluralistic, not to say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly well satisfied with a universe composed of many original principles, provided we be only allowed to believe that the divine principle remains supreme, and that the others are subordinate.</p></blockquote><p>James acknowledges that both philosophy and mysticism have traditionally gravitated towards monotheistic beliefs in a single, all-encompassing God, but he contends that the practical needs and experiences of religion can be met by a belief in a larger, friendly power that is not necessarily infinite or solitary (and can be met through posting no gods whatever, such as through literature and art). He suggests that this larger power could be a more godlike self or a collection of such selves, which would effectively result in a form of polytheism. James’ own pragmatism philosophy can be seen as a form of polytheism in the sense that it rejects the idea of a unified, absolute truth or a single set of principles governing all aspects of human life and instead it embraces a more context-dependent, adaptable approach to understanding the world, allowing for multiple, co-existing viewpoints and values.</p><p>And moreover the existence of evil in the world is a common problem in religious thought, particularly for monotheistic religions that posit an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent deity. Since everything must have its foundation in God, the existence of evil becomes harder to reconcile on this vision of an all loving monistic entity that is ultimately responsible for all actual and logically possible affairs, including evil ones. On the other hand, the existence of multiple gods with varying powers and intentions can help explain the presence of evil, as not all gods are assumed to be all good or all powerful. </p><p>So in short, pre-Wahhabi gods were vastly more superior than Ibn Abdulwahab’s god, pragmatically, philosophically, logically, and not to say aesthetically (though that again cannot be ascertain as the latter is apparently ineffable). They are flexible and adapt to societal needs and the wide range of complex human experiences and emotions. They foster a greater degree of tolerance and inclusivity given that they inherently recognise multiple divine beings and paths to spiritual truth. And they have immediate relevance in that individuals can often find a specific deity or set of deities that resonate with their personal experiences, values, and needs or the specific task they wish to perform.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Ibn Abdulwahab’s Early Years</h2><p>I hope that by now, despite the multiple digressions, the reader has gleaned a general portrait of the Arabian religious and societal climate during the 18th century and the comparative pluralism that was held when it came to what and how many deities one was allowed to worship or invoke.</p><p>Born in the year of 1703, in the humble hamlet of Uyayna, nestled within the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, young Ibn Abdulwahab grew up amidst an epoch marked by fervent religious and tribal strife, whilst the once-mighty Ottoman Empire's grasp upon the region waned. His lineage, an apparently significant element that Arab chroniclers and biographers are too careful not to neglect, harks back to the <em>Bani Tamim</em>, a formidable tribe with wandering offshoots that continue to reside in the regions encircling Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Hailing from a lineage renowned for their devout scholarship, the young man was bequeathed with an unshakable foundation in the intricacies of Islamic erudition.  Under the watchful eyes of his sire, Abdul Wahhab, and other local savants, he received a rigorous education encompassing Islamic jurisprudence, divine theology, and the exegesis of the Holy Quran. </p><p>Similar to numerous prosperous Nejdians, the son of Abdul Wahab embarked his vocation as a peripatetic trader, initially voyaging towards Medina, Basrah and Baghdad, and though some authors maintain that he had traveled to Persia, India, and even Constantinople, these declarations remain hitherto uncorroborated. His commerce eventually led him to Damascus, wherein he met the learned and somewhat doctrinaire sheikhs of the metropolis, who, akin to himself, identified as <em>Hanbalis</em> or <em>Shafi'is</em> and shared a mutual opposition to the more progressive and liberal views of the <em>Nakshbandis</em> and other northern rationalists, as well as the mystical practices of the <em>darweeshs</em> and other Persian or Turkish influences that had pervaded the Orient.</p><p>At that juncture, Abd al-Wahhab was beyond thirty years of age, at the zenith of his corporeal and intellectual capacities, boasting exceptional talents in abstraction and generalisation. He drunk from the rigorous instructions of the Damascene sheikhs and eventually amalgamated concepts that had heretofore been indistinct and disorganised among themselves. Through these peregrinations, too, he acquainted himself with a plethora of intellectual currents, embracing the austere Hanbali legal tradition and imbibing the teachings of the venerable Ibn Taymiyyah, a medieval savant who ardently championed a return to the pristine founts of Islam—the Quran and the Sunnah.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Ibn Abdulwahab's Puritanism: A Closer Examination</h2><p>He ultimately acquired the ability to distinguish between the fundamental, ‘essences’ of Islam and its more recent or contingent accretions, eventually returning to the original viewpoint and basis of the Prophet and his initial disciples in Hejaz twelve centuries prior. To the son of Abdul Wahhab is attributed the rediscovering of the long-lost keystone amid the wreckage of the Islamic edifice, and, even more dashing, daring and even daunting, of possessing the temerity to conceive a scheme to restore it, employing it to rebuild the fragmented structure from then bottom up from whence it was.</p><p>This central premise from which all else logically follows is embodied in the oft-recited, habitually misapprehended, maxim, "La ilaha illa Allah," that is, "there is no god but God", a maxim that is a product of a history associated with the Meccan pantheon of deities described earlier. Hence the incessant relation of the maxim, a reminder that the gods of Mecca are naught, and the acclamation of the name of the monistic deity (<em>talbiya</em>) during the Hajj pilgrim, chanting</p><blockquote><p>Here we are O Lord! Here we are! Here we are!</p><p>Thou hast no associate save one who is thine.</p><p>Thou hast dominion over him and over what he possessed!.</p></blockquote><p>Declaring his unity at a time in which this unity was precarious and not fully established among the Arabs.</p><p>While this is a verbatim translation, it is inadequate in conveying the complete import and influence of the Arabic phrase as it reverberates within the soul of the Wahhabi. As Palgrave (1865) explains, though "There is no god but God" in English seems to merely negate the presence of any divinity save for one, the expression encompasses far more; its full meaning not only confirms the absolute oneness of the Supreme Being, devoid of any multiplicity in essence or persona, but it also conveys that this singular, exalted entity is the sole operative force, the lone agent, and the unique origin of action throughout the cosmos. As a result, all other entities, whether corporeal or ethereal, innate or sentient, physical or ethical, are rendered in a condition of pure, unadulterated passivity, irrespective of motion or quiescence, action or possibility; and the only might, movement, vigour, and activity belong to God, while everything else, from the most exalted archangel to the humblest amoeba, even atom, epitomises torpor and sheer instrumentality. </p><p>Thus, within the mere solitary expression "La ilaha illa Allah," we discern the quintessence of a belief system that is the ultimate self-abnegation to the non-human, in which all is subsumed within the despotic will of the singular, all-embracing Agent—who is moreover, fervently jealous of others being worshiped over Him. As a result of this jealousy, He is more predisposed to chastise than to bestow, to inflict pain rather than grant delight, and to demolish rather than construct. His singular gratification lies in perpetually reminding created beings that they are naught but His slaves, subjects and tools—contemptible ones at that—so they may better acknowledge His supremacy and comprehend that His might, guile, will, and arrogance exceed their own—or rather, that there exists no power, guile, will, or arrogance apart from His.</p><p>Naturally, then, what was central to Ibn Abdulwahab's puritanism was the notion of <em>tawhid</em>, or the absolute oneness of God (Lacroix, 2011). He fervently believed that the veneration of saints, tomb visitation, and the intercession of religious figures constituted acts of shirk, or associating partners with God, and thus violated the cardinal principle of <em>tawhid</em>. His most known texts include <em>The Book of Monotheism</em>, <em>Clarification of Doubts</em> and <em>The Three Principles</em>. In the former, Ibn Abdulwahab writes:</p><blockquote><p>Know that the most egregious sin is to associate partners with Allah. It is the only sin that Allah does not forgive, for He says, 'Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills' [Quran 4:48] (Ibn Abdulwahab, 2003).</p></blockquote><p>Thus murder, torture and the like may be forgiven, but the notion that there are other gods is absolutely repelled by this envious One. This unwavering adherence to <em>tawhid</em> guided Ibn Abdulwahab's puritanical vision, shaping his views on a host of other religious practices, as when he vehemently opposed the use of charms and talismans, considering them to be tantamount to idolatry. In a letter addressed to the people of the Arabian Peninsula, Ibn Abdulwahab declared:</p><blockquote><p>Cease the practice of wearing amulets, for it is a form of polytheism. Allah Almighty says, 'And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him' [Quran 12:106] (Ibn Abdulwahab, as cited in Al-Durar al-Saniyyah, n.d.).</p></blockquote><p>In accordance with this narrative as championed and instructed by the Wahabbi school of thought, predestination (or rather predamnation) is an organising principle. When God resolved to create humankind, He procured a lump of earth, clay, from which all people were to originate and wherein they, in a manner of speaking, pre-existed in another form. Haphazardly dividing the matter into two parts, He hurled one half into the inferno and cast the other half into heaven. God consigns one individual to eternal suffering in fetters and seas of scorching fire, while another is endowed with the ultimate delight of an everlasting celestial abode accompanied by forty heavenly beauties, both outcomes determined solely by His own volition and because He desires it. Above all, the principle endures: "La Ilah illa Allah," "there is no god but God." </p><p>Subsequent doctrines and schools that introduced free will, merit, hierarchical structures, human interdependence, intercessors, mediators, sacred sites, revered saints. Sepulchers or founded ascetic fraternities and Sufi orders were now identified by the Wahhabis as novelties, contaminations, and perversions of the grand and unadorned vision of one absolute sovereign presiding over a uniform multitude of undifferentiated and indistinct serfs.</p><p>Nonetheless, while the theoretical inference was inescapable, the practical execution was equally evident. Consequently, the Wahhabi reformist deduced that the demarcation ought to be drawn at the existence of Muhammad and those who, by virtue of their intimate personal affiliation, could be regarded as one with the Prophet himself. The era of the Sahhabah signified the utmost boundary of what Islam could acknowledge and incorporate; anything beyond that was incongruous and adverse. Mohammed ibn Abd al-Wahhab devoted the remainder of his days to restoring this pristine form of Islam, the Islam of Muhammad, the Sahhabah, and now his own, persuaded that this was the sole authentic, infallible, divinely disclosed path, and all else constituted mere human augmentation.</p><p>The Wahhabi reformist endeavored to rewind the chronology of Islam to its genesis, which, in a manner, Islam was purposed to remain unaltered from the outset. At its essence, Islam is static and was designed to persist as such and anything that exhibits dynamism and motion is, by that very fact, indicted of heterodoxy and apostasy.</p><p>I do not wish to commentate too much but merely maintain, with Palgrave, that life presupposes movement and maturation, both of which entail transformation; that it is unreasonable to reproach a living being for growing and metamorphosing; and that endeavouring to hinder it from doing so by confining it to a textual denomination or coercing it into a Puritarian framework is essentially tantamount to extinguishing it entirely. Stasis is Wahhabisms’ guiding precept and a fundamental necessity; thus, the son of 'Abd-el-Wahhab, in striving to revert Islam to its original simplicity and converting its inception into its ultimate aim, was to a certain extent accurate and exhibited a profound comprehension of the nature and foundational notions of his faith. </p><p>It is essential to acknowledge that Ibn Abdulwahab's teachings were not entirely original; rather, he adeptly synthesised and encapsulated the works of preceding scholars, such as Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, and substantially drew upon the work of the Yemeni Muhammad ibn Isma'il San'ani, titled <em>Purification of the Doctrine from the Filth of Unbelief</em>. As San'ani journeyed through regions of the Arabian Peninsula, encompassing Yemen, Tihama, and the Hijaz, he observed practices that, in his estimation, contradicted the tenets of Islam. San'ani was particularly troubled by the widespread cult of the dead and the veneration of living charlatans professing expertise in occultism and mysticism. Consequently, he penned his seminal work, delving into these matters and calling for a return to the purity of Islamic doctrine:</p><blockquote><p>From this you have all learned that if someone believes that any of a tree, stone, grave, angel, jinni, the living and the dead, can help or harm, or approach God, or intercede with Him for mundane needs . . . they thus associated things to God and believed in what it is not allowed to believe, as polytheists (mushrikūn) believe in idols. Not to speak of one who makes a vow upon his property or son to the dead or the living, or demands of them what can be only demanded from the Exalted God. This is indeed exactly the same polytheism (shirk) of the idolaters (ʿubbād al-as.nām). Making vows to the dead with property, making sacrifices on graves, seeking help from the dead, and asking favours from them is exactly the same polytheism as in the pre-Islamic period of barbarism (jāhilīya).</p></blockquote><p>And though Wahhabi scholars draw on al-San'ani to legitimise Ibn Al-Wahhab’s doctrines, yet, as per the account of Michael Cook, al-San'ani scrutinised several of Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's works in 1756 and deduced that the Shaykh was a poorly educated and naive individual who had not sought guidance from learned scholars. Instead, he had studied the works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, adopting their views in a simplistic and flawed manner. Furthermore, al-Amir al-San'ani withdrew his support for the destruction of graves a year later upon learning of the Wahhabis' rampant excommunication (takfir) of fellow Muslims, including the Zaydis, and the brutality they unleashed during their expansionist campaigns. It is said that he composed a poem condemning Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab for the bloodshed caused by those who revered the dead in their graves.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Return to Najd and the Rise of Wahhabism</h2><p>Brimming with zeal for his undertaking and resolute in seeing it to fruition, Ibn Abdulwahab made his return to his native land of Najd after an absence of six years, a significant portion of which he had spent in Damascus. During that era, Central Arabia was fragmented among numerous chieftains, the most formidable being Ebn-Ma'ammer in 'Eyanah in Wadi Haneefah and Da'as in the consequential district of Manfoohah in Kharj. Nevertheless, these potentates and their rivals were broadly under the dominion of Ebn-Muflik, who succeeded the Carmathian princes in Kateef and Hasa.</p><p>When he arrived, Ibn Abdalwahhab found himself increasingly disquieted by what he deemed a lamentable departure from the true essence of Islam. By that juncture, nearly every trace of Islam had vanished from Najd. The adoration of the Djann, carried out beneath towering trees or within the recesses of Djebel Toweyk, was amalgamated with supplications to the deceased and offerings presented at their sepulchers. This amalgam was infused with remnants of archaic Saban superstitions, and even discernible influences from the doctrines of Moseylemah (who is condemned by name by the author of the Quran) and Kermoot—all pagan rituals which the puritan Ibn Abdulwahab thought was incongruous to the essence of Islam. Practices such as the adoration of saints, pilgrimages to tombs, and the intercession of spiritual luminaries were, in his eyes, tantamount to idolatry and polytheism. </p><p>The Quran was moreover no longer perused, the quintet of daily prayers had been forsaken, and the direction of Mecca held no significance whatever. Tithes, ablutions, and pilgrimages were now unheard of notions, and the political and religious state of the territory was in disheveled disarray. Convinced that these practices were anathema to the purity of the faith, Ibn Abdulwahab resolved to resurrect what he took to be the original form of Islam by advocating for unyielding adherence to the sacred teachings of the Quran and Sunnah as supposedly practiced by men and women living during the 7th century BC, whilst repudiating all manner of religious innovation, or <em>bid'ah</em>.</p><p>Ibn Abdulwahab departed his place of birth, Uyayna, and resettled in the more prominent town of 'Eyanah, under the aegis of its ruler, Ebn-Ma'ammer. Myriad and hyperbolised tales circulated within Najd regarding the erstwhile splendour of 'Eyinah and the despotism of its chieftains. Ibn Abdulwahab’s ardor was intense, yet not impetuous, for he understood the necessity of patiently and prudently awaiting the incremental unfolding of his grand schemes. For a period, he resided in a house near the marketplace, leading a tranquil and nearly secluded existence, abstaining from preaching or striving to differentiate himself from the masses.</p><p>Ibn Abdulwahab's personal disposition and worldly experiences swiftly garnered him the reverence and admiration customarily accorded to those possessing knowledge, eloquence, and affluence in Arabia. He also struck a formidable chord in the hearts of those who lived in Najd – a fear inspired not by his personal demeanour, but by the potency of his written word. As it happened, few of his contemporaries had the opportunity to cross paths with the man himself, given that the most significant years of his life were devoted to serving the later monarch and attending to his court where he held the esteemed position of exclusive advisor. The sense of trepidation that pervaded the era owed its existence to the vehement, unyielding, and obstinate dogmatism with which Ibn Abdulwahab sought to dismantle the doctrines he deemed unworthy, instilling a sense of dread in the hearts and minds of those who opposed him.</p><p>Though at this particular juncture in our tale, everyone still recognised and esteemed him, including Ebn-Ma'ammer. In due course, Ibn Abdulwahab discerned that the moment had arrived to pursue his ambitious design, and ere long, an occasion presented itself in which he was able to make himself obnoxious to the city dwellers. One evening, as he reclined upon the rooftop of his abode, overlooking the marketplace, a man who had misplaced a camel ambled past, vociferously invoking Sa'ad, the local demigod or patron saint of the city (which is also, by the way, an Arabic given male name literally meaning ‘happiness’), to aid him in locating the lost beast. "Why not implore the God of Sa'ad instead?" the Wahhabi proclaimed, with sufficient volume for all those in the market and street to overhear. This extraordinary expression, unspoken for centuries in 'Eyanah, incited curiosity, which in turn led to debates and their customary consequences. This encounter, one among many, would serve as a harbinger for the his zealous modern instantiation in Saudi Arabia’s infamous Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.</p><p>The barrier had been surmounted, and soon the inhabitants of 'Eyanah found themselves divided into two factions: one advocating for Sa'ad and the other championing Allah. The disciples of the new instructor multiplied in both quantity and zeal with each passing day.</p><p>The act of tearing down a tomb, in conjunction with the toppling of hallowed trees and the infrequent practice of stoning adulteresses, became emblematic of the Wahhabi movement's character ever since. A particular grave, located in al-Jubayl within Wadi Hanifa, was allegedly desecrated by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab himself. This tomb was believed to be the resting place of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, brother to the second caliph, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, and a companion of Muhammad. This revered site was frequented by numerous devotees who offered prayers to Zayd, and its selection for destruction by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab was calculated. It has been reported that the denizens of the oasis intended to protect their sacred space, but upon witnessing Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab accompanied by a force of 600 men, they stepped aside and observed the dismantling of their cherished site.</p><p>Ebn-Ma'ammer maintained an air of nonchalance concerning the religious discord in the town. Nonetheless, several distinguished townsfolk, more attached to their ancient beliefs and customs, perceived the gravity of the situation. After multiple fruitless endeavours to rouse Ebn-Ma'ammer from his inertia, they apprised the supreme governor at Kateef, Ebn-Muflik, of the burgeoning doctrine's rapid proliferation and the local chieftain's negligence. They further cautioned him about the perils of Islam's revival, not solely in 'Eyanah but throughout Najd.</p><p>As a Carmathian, Ebn-Muflik harboured animosity towards Muslims. He promptly dispatched instructions to Ebn-Ma'ammer to cease the preaching and apprehend the preacher, menacing dire consequences if he persisted in supporting the Wahhabi. Rather than fully complying, an action that might have potentially snuffed out the nascent movement, Ebn-Ma'ammer adopted a lukewarm approach. He informed Ibn Abdulwahab that he could no longer safeguard him and counselled him to depart the vicinity to avert capture and any further ramifications.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Saudi Coalition and the Inheritance of Ibn Abdulwahab: A Persistent Imprint upon the Gulf</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png" width="614" height="716.2234156820623" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1086,&quot;width&quot;:931,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:614,&quot;bytes&quot;:1522721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F406ddc6c-e258-4d4d-bb66-eb8735500091_931x1086.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mohammed Ibn Saud, first Saudi Monarch (I do not believe this is an actual photograph).</figcaption></figure></div><p>This seeming reversal of fortune, in actuality, signified a pivotal moment for the Wahhabi prospects, and he exploited it to his benefit. A mere six leagues from 'Eyinah, in a separate branch of Wadi Haneefah, stood the stronghold of Derey'eeyah, fated for both grand renown and a woeful downfall. Here, amidst a small yet resolute populace, resided Saood, the son of 'Abd-el-'Azeez and grandson of the elder Sa'ood, the inaugural chieftain of the district. Saood was a descendant of the 'Anezah clan and a member of the great family of Rabee'aá'l-Feres, and the current ruler, Sa'ood-eth-Thinee or the second, was young, brave, and enjoyed the loyal support of his relatives and followers.</p><p>Positioned between Ebn-Ma'ammer to the north and Dais to the southeast, Sa'ood found himself the object of envy from both sides, and his principality faced significant danger from these formidable and antagonistic neighbors. Mohammed arrived at Sa'ood's stronghold in 1760, seeking sanctuary, which an Arab chieftain rarely denies to a refugee and supplicant. However, their roles soon reversed as Saood discerned the potential in the preacher and became a convert himself and even married his daughter. </p><p>This was made easier by the help of an Arab woman, one Mudha, the spouse of Amir Saud, who interceded on behalf of Ibn Abdul-Wahab, his further father-in-law, playing a crucial role in the ultimate success of the Wahhabi movement. Upon learning of the reformer and his mission, divine love for Ibn Abdul-Wahab was instilled in the heart of Mudha. Simultaneously, Amir Saud was deeply enamoured with Mudha, who was likely his favoured wife. Heeding her counsel, she said, "This man has been sent to you by Allah; offer him your protection and form an alliance with him." Consequently, Amir Saud complied with her request, providing Ibn Abdul-Wahab the safety and support he needed.</p><p>Trusting the youthful ruler's ardent spirit , Mohammed divulged a plan with extensive implications for both this world and the next. He expounded on the plan's character and resources, and concluded by asking the Chief to pledge him his word to make the cause of God his cause, and the sword of Islam his sword, and in return, Ibn al Wahhab will position in him as the sole monarch of Najd  and the first potentate in Arabia, to which Sa’ood consented. He adopted Islam in its most unadulterated form under the tutelage of ibn Al Wahhab, selecting him as his exclusive advisor and mentor.</p><p>The territory extending from the borders of Mecca to the Persian Gulf had been conquered by Saud, the chief of Derey'eeyah, by the time of his death, his progress readily facilitated by the decline and collapse of 'Eyänah by internal upheavals that followed from misgovernment and despotism. Under the appellation by which he was commonly recognised, Ibn Al Wahhab dedicated his waning years to the edification of Derey'eeyah, providing succour to Saud's martial pursuits through his erudite compositions and religious instruction. I have perused many of his scholarly works, which predominantly elucidate and substantiate the principles peculiar to his religious following. Such writings might be regarded with admiration by a Supralapsarian, or even be confused with the Acts of the Synod of Dort by an Antinomian.</p><p>Ibn Al Wahhab exhibited an unwavering earnestness in his devotions and refrained from wielding political influence or asserting any entitlement to meddle in matters of the state, left contented with his station as a spiritual guide and basking in the esteem of those in his proximity until his days drew to a close. His mortal remains were interred in Derey'eeyah, preceding the demise of his benefactor Saud, and he left in his wake a lineage of sons with a multitude of reported appellations. The scions of the Ibn Wahhab line have consistently occupied the most exalted positions in the judiciary and the religious hierarchy of the Wahhabi realm, amassing considerable fortunes along the way.</p><p>It has been chronicled that in the course of his life, Ibn Abdulwahab entered into matrimonial unions with several women, siring numerous progeny (Lacroix, 2011). It is said that his marriages were marked by an atmosphere of piety, discipline, and a shared commitment to the austere principles he espoused. His offspring, reared within the confines of this puritanical home, would come to bear witness to the fervour of their father's convictions, with some even following in his footsteps, championing the cause of the Wahhabi creed.</p><p>In the fullness of time, as the sands shifted beneath the feet of history, the puritanical views forged in Ibn Abdulwahab's youth would become entrenched, emerging as the bedrock of what many now regard as the ‘true Islam’ (Al-Rasheed, 2010). When the concept of religion is separated from the potential to cause humiliation and suffering to those who do not adhere to the "right" beliefs, it becomes less appealing to a significant number of individuals. The appeal further diminishes for even more people when the assurance of reuniting with our cherished ones after passing away is also removed from the equation. In stark contrast to the more liberal interpretation that suffused the milieu of his era, the austere doctrines Ibn Abdulwahab espoused would come to be accepted as a return to the faith's origins, the one and true interpretation, indelibly altering the course of Islamic history.</p><p>From that moment, three centuries ago, until today, the enduring alliance between the missionary endeavours of the Wahhabis and the martial prowess of the Sauds has persisted. This partnership combined religious fervour with the power of the sword and devised a Puritanism unexampled hitherto in the Arab world.</p><p>After an additional twenty years of conflict, Saud's grandson and namesake, Saud the Great, achieved victory over the entire peninsula, including the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, thereby consolidating the Unitarian faith across the region. Wahhabism spread widely into the Arabian peninsula and the Wahhabis of the 19th and early 20th century were especially distin­guished by a puritanical self-abasement and self-mortification, and a stern opposition to the pleasures of the world and especially tobacco, silk and wine.</p><p>Ibn Abdulwahab's puritanical doctrine, once the animating force of a singular man's vision, has indelibly marked the contemporary Gulf, particularly in the land of Saudi Arabia, his teachings suffusing the very fabric of the region's socio-religious life, shaping the disposition and beliefs of a multitude. The austere interpretation of Islam he championed has been institutionalised in sundry aspects of the nation's religious, educational, and legal spheres, fostering a climate wherein the teachings of Ibn Abdulwahab are oft taken for granted as the true expression of Islam, superseding more liberal interpretations.</p><p>In the final analysis, this ominous precursor of present-day ISIS was a staunch absolutist, an unyielding theocrat, and a resolute legitimist, worshipping a grotesque unity that placed God at the apex and the lowly human bellow. He was a tireless advocate for the most severe, narrow, and inflexible dogmatism, a shadowy figure hailing from the Dark Ages, part theocrat, part inquisitor, and part monarchist. His Islam was characterised by terror, passive obedience, and a religion subsumed by the state; his God thrived solely through the sword of the burgeoning monarch. Arrogant, bigoted, and unwavering, he nevertheless possessed a formidable will and an uncanny ability to reason dogmatically, reaching extreme and unpalatable conclusions from fairly innocuous premises.</p><p>Ibn Abdulwahab was an uncreative anomaly, fearsome, antagonistic, isolated, and ultimately pitiable. At his best, he was a tragic, patrician figure defying and denouncing a duplicitous and base world into which he had been incongruously born, looking unto the past for inspiration. At his worst, he was an obstinate, self-deceived diehard, hurling curses at the wondrous tolerance of the age whose benefits he was too obstinate to recognise and too cold-hearted to appreciate.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Jihad Against Television </h2><p>A fascinating example of the degree to which Ibn Abdulwahab's teachings have permeated the Gulf can be found in the realm of technology. </p><p>In the nascent years of television, circa the 1960s, the innovative technology engendered considerable controversy among the religious scholars of Saudi Arabia. Drawing upon Ibn Abdulwahab's austere interpretation of bid'ah, or religious innovation, some scholars opined that television, as an unfamiliar and modern contraption, constituted a deviation from the pristine purity of Islamic teachings and was thus impermissible (Kraidy, 2002).</p><p>One notable scholar of that era, Sheikh Abdulaziz Bin Baz, issued a fatwa denouncing television as a pernicious instrument, declaring that it corrupted morals and propagated sin (Ayalon, 1995). In his fatwa, he asserted that television was a tool of the devil, which distracted the faithful from their religious duties and encouraged them to engage in illicit activities.</p><p>In response to this theological opposition, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, a proponent of modernisation, sought to assuage the concerns of the religious establishment. He invited a delegation of prominent scholars to the Royal Palace for a demonstration of television, showcasing its potential as an instrument for religious education and the dissemination of Islamic values (Ayalon, 1995). This endeavor gradually allayed the apprehensions of some religious scholars, who came to perceive television as a medium that could be harnessed for the promotion of Islam.</p><div><hr></div><h3>References:</h3><p>Al-Rasheed, M.
