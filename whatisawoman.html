<p>"God is not known, he is not understood, he is used—sometimes as meat-purveyor, sometimes as moral support, sometimes as friend, sometime as an object of love. If he proves himself useful, the religious consciousness can ask no more than that. Does God really exist? How does he exist? What is he? are so many irrelevant questions. Not God, but life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is, in the last analysis, the end of religion."
—James Henry Leuba

<p>Many philosophical and ideological debates often hinge on disagreements over what "exists" or what is "real", in an ontological sense. This is certainly the case in debates between atheists and theists. Atheists may argue that belief in God causes greater suffering, but the theists see this as missing the point; God does exist, God and souls are real entities. While on the other hand, so-called “nominal theists” and social gospel theologians may argue religious belief makes them happy, to which atheists may retort that they’re missing the point; God doesn’t exist. There is no such entity.

<p>What is shared between both camps is the adherence to what Hegel called “onto-theology”; the obsession over metaphysics, over “grounding” their arguments on what is ontologically ‘out there’. This is an ancient Platonic need to prostrate against something non-human and towards what is really anyway there, irrespective of questions of human happiness and well-being. Yet we find that, in the final analysis, the only relevant question in the dispute, the one that we actually engage with in practice, is the question of how we may best carve out our linguistic and social practices with respect to religion in a way that contributes to our goals and interests. The reflection on the ontological status of religious entities or the will of a purported deity only comes to the fore in hindsight, after questions about whether talk about such entities serve relevant social and normative goals, such as the goal of human brotherhood and love or hope and meaning .

<p>In a similar vein, the question of whether gender categories are 'real' in an ontological sense is much less pertinent than the question of how we can best refine our linguistic practices when we talk about gender. It is often said, for example, that we should use language that affirms a person’s identity and experiences, such as saying "assigned female at birth (AFAB)" or "assigned male at birth (AMAB)" rather than "biologically female/male”, that we should refer to people by their preferred pronouns, update public signage to use more inclusive language, and to stop using the concepts “tranny” and “she-male”. The idea is to lessen the chances that questions like "What was their biological sex?" or "Is this person 'really' a man or a woman?" will be seen as relevant. The focus here is about how we may best refine our linguistic practices when we talk about gender, and hopefully come to the resolve that we ought to do so in a way such that fewer and fewer kids will grow up being asked, 'Why do you act the way you do when you're supposed to be something else?' and fewer and fewer of them will grow up severely distressed about the conflict between their identities and their bodies, and about how their family and friends treats them, and be condemned for wanting to change that.

<p>Critics counter this line of thought by saying, "But biology does matter; sex is real." The rejoinder is: there certainly are biological markers between human populations associated with sex, but these markers do not, in themselves, correlate with any characteristics that give us good reasons to treat those individuals in a specific way as opposed to some other way. In medical contexts, understanding genetic and hormonal differences may be important, but not for most other contexts. So, the questions "Do these gendered categories exist in the way we traditionally thought?" and "Should we continue to talk of them in these ways?" are pretty much the same.

<p>Unfortunately, however, onto-theology is still heavily part of our culture, with recent obsession over the metaphysics of gender overpopulating our thoughts. This brings us to… What is a woman? The question sparked endless debates and even political movements as gender identity and expression have become increasingly complex and fluid. While the conservative side of the debate leans on essentialist claims rooted in biological determinism, many progressives nevertheless indulge the question by attempting to define the essence of 'womanhood' in their own terms.

<p>But again we're asking the wrong question.

<p>The question 'what is a woman?', like the question ‘does God exists?’, is poorly framed, not because it lacks an answer, but because it assumes a representationalist view of language and ontology. This Platonic grasp on our culture attempts to define gender categories based on pre-existing "natural kinds," and assumes that language serves to accurately represent these kinds, so that those who wish to reform language are failing to track such representation.

<p>If, however, we follow Wittgenstein’s use-conditional approach to language and meaning instead, we will free ourselves with the fixation over ontological categories and essentialist definitions and turn our gaze towards the more pressing normative and pragmatic concerns. Rather than trying to pin down the essence and metaphysics of gender, we would be asking how, above all else, can we maintain or reform parts of our linguistic practices so that more people can lead richer lives.

<p>For all attempts to assert an authority higher than our social concerns - be it God, Truth, Reality, Biology, or Human Nature - are, in the end, disguised manoeuvres over such concerns. These asserted authorities are not, as their proponents hold them to be, language-independent or universal, but are products of past generations’ own social and linguistic practices. As these authorities don't exist independently of human practices, they should not, therefore, be accorded a primacy that supersedes or negates their social origins. So again, the ultimate question is thus: ‘how can we use our linguistic and social practices to make the world better for us to live in?’, as opposed to the question of whether p or q really exists.

<p>People who do appeal to a divine or metaphysically distinct authority in disputes about how to carve our linguistic practices often seem to have a clear idea of what this authority commands or desires. And yet, these commands and desires also just so happens to be closely aligned with their existing moral and social beliefs, which are, in turn, shaped by their specific cultural and societal context. What is being presented as a metaphysical mandate, in other words, often merely reflects whatever happens to be part of the linguistic norms the individual is socialised into in their respective linguistic community, and the sleight of hand of adding metaphysical weight to this norm, such as in claiming that it is part of “Human Nature” or corresponds to “Reality”, is nothing more than a table thumping exercise.

<p>So going back to the ‘What is a woman’ question, the injunction I’m proposing demands prioritising normative considerations about how we ought to carve out our concepts with respect to gender, over pointless metaphysical investigations on its “essence”. The shift is particularly needed at a time where many media outlets are increasingly looking for ways to stratify society and assign blame for societal ills. Alarmingly, their attention is steadily shifting towards scapegoating the newest minority on the block—transgender individuals. Backed by pseudo-intellectual arguments, this scapegoating tactic uses quasi-fascistic strategies championed by neoconservative figures like Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro on one side, and gender-critical feminists like J. K. Rowling on the other.

<p>In the following sections I delve deep into and dismantle two related frameworks which I take to be influencing much of current transphobic rhetoric. The first is representationalism, the view that reality has an intrinsic nature which the task of language is to represent. And the second is essentialism, which holds that objects must have a set of properties that are necessary for their identity. They are both related because they both stem from foundationalism: the belief that the task of inquiry is to discover ahistorical and necessary foundations for our current cultural practices, ranging from the sciences to religion, ethics, and art.

                Many philosophical queries, largely inherited from 17th century epistemology and metaphysics, center on uncovering the inherent nature of things, or, as Derrida phrased it, "a full presence beyond the reach of play." This search for hidden essences—which is taken as being important for its own sake—amounts to tedious questions over matters, such as:

<p>“What is qualia?”

<p>“What is Knowledge?”

<p>“Are there really universals?”

<p>“How do we know what we know?”

<p>“Do we know p, or its mere appearance?”

<p>“Is there a place of value in a world of fact?”

<p>“Are there moral or epistemic facts independent of any stances?”

<p>“Do these facts alone give us reasons for acting or believing?”

<p>“How many grains make a heap?”

<p>“Why is there something rather than nothing?”

<p>“What is time?”

<p>“Does God exist?”

<p>“Do we have free will?”

<p>The common issue with these questions isn't that they lack answers, but that they are linguistically deceptive and poorly framed. Because of the way they grammatically appear, they seem expectant of an answer—when they shouldn’t be. All they do is merely mimick the syntactic structure of answerable questions such as “is there a cup in that cupboard?”.

<p>Take, for example, the clearly ill-formed question, "Do chairs enjoy listening to Lady Gaga?" The question is perfectly grammatical coherent. But when taken in speech form, the question is semantically vacuous because it applies words and structures from our lived experiences to contexts where they have no meaningful application, and therefore just one more example of our tendency to treat all noun-like entities similarly.

<p>Likewise, the classic “why is there something rather than nothing” assumes a grammatical form that invites an answer, but is mere gobbledygook because it has no application in that context. In everyday conversation we employ the term 'why' to ask for causes or reasons within a predefined system of understanding—typically within the boundaries of human experience. But when we ask 'why' about the totality of existence itself, we are misapplying the term ‘why’ in a way that strays from how the word functions in our language.

<p>The allure of these philosophical investigations, as argued by Richard Rorty in 'Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature' (1979), stems from analytic philosophy's dogmatic commitment to representationalism.

Representationalism rests on three premises:

<p>1. Reality has an intrinsic nature.

<p>2. There is a medium that represents reality, thus bridging the 'self' and 'reality'.

<p>3. This act of representation is valuable for its own sake.

<p>Traditionally, the mind has been perceived as such a medium. But due to the nebulous nature of consciousness, language emerged as a preferred medium with the analytic turn in philosophy, particularly following Gottlob Frege's 'The Foundations of Arithmetic'. On this view, true descriptions represent a pre-discursive reality, such that sentences (e.g. Newton’s) are not just more useful than other sentences (e.g. Aristotle’s) but are more useful because they correspond to How The World Really Is.

<p>This is often referred to as the correspondence theory. The correspondence theory of mind and language maintains that our mental constructs and sensory impressions are linked to real, external objects and phenomena that exist independently of human thought and social engagement. These objects and conditions remain constant, regardless of whether humans are aware of them or even if humanity exists. For example, our concept of "fruit" aligns with a biological classification of certain types of edible plants. This classification exists outside of any human-generated criteria for differentiating fruits from, say, vegetables or grains. In the same way, according to the correspondence theory of language, our words point to actual objects, and our sentences aim to describe states of affairs. A sentence is considered false if it doesn't accurately represent the way things are, and true if it does. This means that the structure of the world exists independently of human language.

<p>Put this way, language is taken to mirrors the intrinsic structure of reality rather than being a tool for coping with it. Words act as pointers to a mental or linguistic representation, something which philosophers might call a ‘proposition’, like a picture referred to by words. And these mental/linguistic entities are taken to correspond to something that, as it were, looms behind such things, something called ‘Reality’. So when I say “this chair in front of me”, this is taken to mean that I have a mental image/proposition about it (as opposed to me simply using signs to communicate some intention I have, and trust that, because of our shared socialisation, my interlocutor interprets the signs as I intended). And this mental image I am referring to, in turn, is taken to represent the nature of reality.
