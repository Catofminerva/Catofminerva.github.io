Her entire brand revolves around exploiting an American audience’s vague sense of guilt for the actions of previous generations whose descendants are now racist as a matter of fact in virtue of the specific variation in human alleles that they inherited, a kind of original sin that can be expiated (only meagrely) through diversity seminars—and maybe purchasing DiAngelo‘s self-help books. </p><p>She coined the term "white fragility" to describe the discomfort and defensiveness that some white people exhibit when their racial worldviews, privileges, or beliefs are challenged. White fragility, she says, holds racism in place because it maintains white dominance and equanimity while silencing or dismissing any conversation or perspective that challenges this norm. She calls on white people to continually “confess their racism”, particularly through her diversity seminars (which, it must be noted, she banks thousands from). Her point is that the whites, no matter how ‘woke’ (what she calls “averse racists’), are <em>prima facie</em> racist because of historical conditions that leads to unconscious psychological bias. She is avowedly against ‘colour-blindism’—the idea that we should abjure race-talk—as, to her, race is a reality we have to contend with.</p><p>DiAngelo does have a point, though it’s a fairly trivial one. People don’t want to be seen as being the bad kind of people. This is simply a psychological fact - many, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, may become defensive when accused of doing something harmful or offensive unbeknownst to them. This defensiveness isn't unique to discussions of racism, nor is it confined to white people qua their having the property of ‘whiteness’. Any uncomfortable conversation that forces us to confront our own potential biases or wrongdoing can trigger this defensive response.</p><p>Let’s suppose every ‘white person’ attends all of DiAngelo’s diversity seminars, they all introspect long and hard about their prejudicial biases, they chant condemnations upon their ancestors’ racist antics. What then? What do we expect to happen next? Nothing is offered in the way of concrete political action against human suffering other than a self-righteous sense of salvation from sin. The idea we get is exactly one of religious atonement: that if only you do enough introspection, enough cognitive cleansing of your innate white racist urges (a Freudian projection on DiAngelo’s part?), perhaps only then you would come to see black people as deserving equal treatment and you could possible finally become a good and honest person. </p><p>The point overlooked is that racism is not a product of a failure to “recognise” racial diversity or falling into “racial microaggressions”; in fact, it is not an interpersonal cognitive bias via skin shade. Or at any rate, defined as narrowly overlooks much of the actual human suffering that occurs under the name ‘racism’. Instead of directly addressing the suffering of groups through policy action, such as advancing investments in predominantly black schools—which will otherwise continue to be worse than schools in predominantly white suburbs—or improving black people’s economic mobility by desegregating cities in the first place, or at any rate addressing other intergenerational disparities, DiAngelo and the White Guilt Industry who profit from such race-talk are more concerned with sustaining the idea of there being a Manichaean picture of BLACK-WHITE identities which cannot be made commensurable even by a common nationality, and it is (according to them) the interpersonal hidden biases and day-to-day ‘microaggressions’ perpetrated by the latter group which urgently needs addressing. In other words, Di Angelo reinforces the idea of incommensurable differences between ‘races’, reifying them, and then pigeonholing individuals into these fixed categories. Meanwhile, while we're busy navel gazing over our respective racial identities, actual power dynamics remain unchallenged. </p><p>It would instead be better to substitute ‘Colour' or ‘race’ with the concept 'social capital', or a form of it, that provides unearned advantages to some groups (traditionally, the white majority in the context of the U.S.) and disadvantages others. The structures that support this form of social capital are not accidental but are designed to perpetuate the status quo. It gives the descendants of those currently in power an automatic advantage because of their a criterion, race, which is visible and therefore cannot be hidden. Racial tensions, in this sense, intensify during times of economic scarcity. When resources are limited and jobs are hard to come by, competition increases, and existing societal fault lines, including racism, are exacerbated. An equitable economic environment where opportunities are not limited seems to me to be the best solution to racism.</p><p>And a step towards mitigating the wealth disparity is, as Richard Rorty noted long ago, “appealing, as Martin Luther King did, to the whites’ sense of justice to their fellow Americans”, instead of preaching that whites and blacks have separate cultural identities and not the same one, which would include the legacies of the Rosa Parks, the Fredrick Douglas’ and the MLKs as well as the Lincolns and the Jane Adams’ as part of its imagined mythos. Instead of seeing America as irredeemably racist and white peoples as irredeemably racist, it would be more fruitful to strike towards an idealistic colour-blind national unity à la Martin Luther King’s dream. </p><p>But hey, if you want some fun reads and maybe a newfound sense of self-flagellation, then maybe check Di Angelo’s pop sociology books out. Just keep in mind that the road to creating a more just world is not guilting ourselves over inherited traits.</p><h2>The Woke Reification of Race</h2><p>The problems with the white fragility concept DiAngelo proposes should be obvious. It posits that simply being “white” entails one will exhibit “white fragility”; that is, all white people exhibit this tendency and if one dares to deny doing so, this counts as evidence that they do indeed exhibit the tendency. It’s unfalsifiable. The internet is populated with reviewers levying such critiques. It also doesn’t help that the book is pompous, jargon-ridden, and self-indulgent.</p><p>My issue, however, is against the very idea of race-talk to begin with, the very idea of talking about “white people” and “black people” as separate identities; and moreover, about race as an explanatory concept. I use DiAngelo's thesis as an example, not because it is unique in its race-talk, but to illustrate how even well-intentioned anti-racist discourse can inadvertently perpetuate racial divisions. What I advocate for is linguistic reform: replacing the term 'race' with more constructive and inclusive language. My hope is that this shift will help alleviate the social injustices that are exacerbated by our current linguistic tools. I envision a world where social categories emphasise our shared human experience and allows us to say, for instance, "I don’t see you as white or black; I see you as American." This ideal has already been realised in parts of South America and elsewhere, yet remains elusive in a North America that remains fixated on race.</p><p>Consider that the best way to think like Di Angelo is to think like a race realist. When you get anchored on this way of thinking, you start to believe that there are entities called ‘races’. You start to believe that a person's race is an unalterable fact, a defining feature that is biologically passed down through generations, and that each race possesses an unobservable, defining essence that makes them unique and which all members of that race share. This supposed racial essence is thought to influence observable traits such as appearance, thought processes, and behaviour.</p><p>You also begin to interpret all events in your personal and social life as being explicable in terms of race relations. You start to think that every injustice that happens to you or others is explainable through interpersonal racism. Your African American friend failed to get a job? The interviewer was racist. Your grandma gave you a five dollar bill for Christmas? It’s because she hates brown people. Your white teacher gave you detention? She’s racist. Your poor white friend denies having benefited from white privilege? White fragility. You get the idea…</p><p>Racism begins when we start to divide humanity into different races - creating an 'us' versus 'them' narrative. The very idea of there being “races” is, in other words, the precondition for racism to occur; racist attitudes cannot be detached from race. It starts by classifying people as fundamentally different, and later morphs into viewing them as subhuman entities deserving of subjugation or annihilation. </p><p>Intrinsic in the idea of ‘races’ is the ascription of stereotypes, assuming a specific race is inherently smarter, more athletic, ‘fragile’ or that every member of a race possesses certain characteristics. This creates a value hierarchy arising from a history of conflict and domination associated with the concept of ‘race’ itself. These beliefs aren't limited to extremist groups, they aren’t exclusive to white and black nationalists. They subtly permeate everyday conversations and are even evident among those who consider themselves "woke" like DiAngelo. So while racial pride may provide a sense of unity and strength in a racist society, it also perpetuates the very circumstances necessitating such unity by reifying race.</p><p>In light of this, why should we continue with race-talk? Some categories are useful some are not. Gender abolitionists argue that gender is not a useful category and that we ought to get rid of gender-talk. Cosmopolitanists argue that we should drop nation-talk. At any rate, carving the human species into different social categories is something we can retrospectively debate about. </p><h2>The Fiction of Race</h2><p>This line of thinking about reforming or abolishing social categories is sometimes countered by saying “but there really <em>are</em> races, races <em>do</em> exist!”</p><p>I have detailed <a href="https://catofminerva.substack.com/p/philosophy-truth-and-the-culture">elsewhere</a> that such a view falls for what I call "Fallacy of Ontological Primacy"; when one mistakenly privileges ontological categories and metaphysics as the primary consideration, to the detriment of social, pragmatic, and normative considerations.</p><p>But another rejoinder towards such race realist rhetoric is that race is, in fact, not “real” in the ontological sense that the realist contends, but rather a pseudo scientific concept on par with alchemy. A spectrum of the shades of human skin tones and human hair textures, human facial morphology and physique certainly <em>does</em> exist; there certainly <em>are</em> slight variations in human genes; there certainly <em>are</em> statistical frequencies in alleles within human population clusters; and these variations sometimes <em>do</em> correlate with societal stereotypes, selective injustice, disempowerment and so on. But all humans are practically identical on a genetic level and most genetic variations exist <em>within</em> so-called “races” rather than <em>between</em> them (they’re just simple not visible characteristics). </p><p>Thus, the demarcation of population clusters into “races” is completely arbitrary; genetic variations such as skin shade exist on spectrums and not in strict binaries, and members within each so-called race simply do not all share the exact same genetic makeup. There could easily have been thousands of ‘races’ given different socio-historic conditions, and one need only look at the Rwandan genocide where Hutu’s and Tutsis viewed each other not only as different “races” but quickly devolved into considering each other as subhumans. Individual humans therefore don’t <em>have</em> “races”, instead, our allelic makeup approximates what’s frequent in one population cluster over another, and what we demarcate socially as “races” rarely coincides with such approximates, nor can these arbitrary demarcations be generalised on an individual-level (not all single individuals within a population cluster will share the same alleles). So ‘race’ is not a property that <em>individuals</em> have, but the statistical average genetic makeup in a population cluster, which any one individual may simply not share despite having one or more similar visible features, like skin colour. So calling an individual ‘Black’ because of visible skin colour is not accurate as their alleles might not at all correlate with the population cluster such category is referencing.</p><p> So why does race-talk persist when ‘population clusters’ does a better job at what we’re trying to describe? Though alchemy-talk was discarded and viewed as silly mumbo jumbo—no one asks which of the elements on the periodic table are earth, which are air, which are water, and which are fire—race-talk somehow still persist. For most people “races” are <em>obviously</em> real. An individual's “race” is taken to influence how they are treated by others and the opportunities they are offered.</p><h2>A Concept Marred by its History  </h2><p>By virtue of a social imagination perpetuated by ancient theories dividing human beings into races, it was no surprise that a hierarchy was instantiated; some ‘races’ began to see themselves as superior. The myth of ‘race’ can be linked back to Aristotle's over two thousand years ago. He divided humans into Greeks and Barbarians, with Barbarians deemed as "natural slaves," placed in a societal hierarchy somewhere between livestock and fully human beings, namely the Greeks. Aristotle's view held that enslavement was beneficial to the Barbarians as they could access the superior rationality of their Greek masters. Needless to say, those Aristotle branded as "Barbarians" didn't see themselves that way. They identified with their ethnic communities, like Scythians, Persians, or Ethiopians, not "Barbarians."But Aristotle grouped these diverse human beings under a single, homogenising label, effectively setting the precedent for viewing Barbarians as a racial group, or something strikingly similar.</p><p>Fast forward several centuries, and Aristotle's doctrine was repurposed by Spanish colonists to justify the enslavement of the New World's indigenous people. This philosophy was so deeply ingrained that a debate organized by the King of Spain between Dominican friar Bartolomé de Las Casas and theologian Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda did not question the moral permissibility of slavery. Instead, the discussion revolved around whether Indians could be categorised as "natural slaves" or not.</p><p>Later, English colonists adopted the theory of natural slavery to vindicate the enslavement of Africans. Prior to the transatlantic slave trade, West Africans did not view themselves as a single, homogenous group. This region housed a myriad of diverse groups with different languages, cultures, and physical characteristics. They would have identified themselves by their specific ethnicities like Igbo, Akan, Wolof, Fulani, rather than a blanket term like "Black". However, it was the Europeans who grouped these distinct cultures under the racial label 'Black', echoing Aristotle's broad-stroke categorisation of non-Greeks as Barbarians. This generalisation was a convenient tool that allowed the Europeans to enslave, exploit, and devalue an entire population for the labor-intensive industries in the New World.</p><p>Drawing parallels with Aristotle, White slaveholders argued that they were doing Africans a favour by enslaving them. In the United States, this concept was backed by pseudo-scientific and medical claims, stating that forced physical labor was beneficial for Black people as it supposedly improved their weak cardiovascular systems and that any enslaved person desiring freedom must be suffering from mental illness (given that their ‘true nature’ is being slaves).</p><p>Today, serious thinkers reject the biological basis to the idea of “race,” understanding them as constructs born from ancestral fascination with superficial differences. This begs the question; why continue using the misleading concept ‘race’, specially given its bleak history? It is inherently hierarchical, arising from a history of conflict and domination. It segregates people, placing some as superior and others as inferior. And there is not biological basis whatever for it. Carving up slight variations into different categories and calling them ‘races’ only opens the path for differential treatment to happen in the first place via re/producing ‘a world of races’. Race-talk sets the conditions of possibility for ‘races’ to be placed in superior-inferior hierarchies and for racial identity to be thought of as having intrinsic value. </p><p>It seems to me that there is no utility gained from continuing to draw such boundaries between these spectrums, just as there is no utility of drawing boundaries between different shades of rocks which can be subdivided into hundreds of millions of categories—the difference is that the former categorising game that Di Angelo et al. advocate and profit from is not just pointless but also pernicious. If the concept ‘race’ is hierarchical by its nature and only encourages a naive and empirically untenable generalisation in which individuals are thought to “have” a race instead of merely being arbitrarily grouped into their allelic makeup approximates of what’s frequent in a given population cluster, then talk of ‘races’ should be abjured. ‘Population clusters’ does all the needed work.</p><p>To respect human diversity in the proper way, according to such view, it is not enough to say that humans are all equal: to treat everyone the same irrespective of inherited traits. You must also start to celebrate the different races, and think of the difference among human beings as not just as slight variations in individual alleles, but as something which, so to speak, looms behind such things—something essential and unique that defines someone’s race. It is ironic that the best way to get into this way of thinking is to become a race realist. To think in this way, you need to take seriously that races have intrinsic value. You must be prepared to distinguish, at least in principle, between racial traits which are essential, and traits that are merely superficial.</p><p>I find myself questioning the drawbacks of striving for an ideal of colour blindness in our personal interactions. It seems to me that this perspective illuminates the commonalities that exist across perceived 'races' and societies, as opposed to glorifying differences under the guise of "cultural/racial sensitivities." Nowadays, there's a booming industry in fields such as postcolonial and race studies that appears rather keen on emphasising these differences, a trend that, to me, seems more harmful than constructive. I prefer to highlight our shared experiences, like the universal sensations of pain, the love we have for our families — experiences that aren't bound by cultural or racial lines but that transcend these perceived barriers and include individuals from all walks of life.</p><p>If we look at the past, say around the 70’s and 80’s, "culture" and “race” weren't as prevalent in political discourse as they are today. Assigning value to diverse cultures or races was somewhat foreign to the prevailing mindset. Egalitarian conversations focused more on overcoming prejudice against marginalised groups, rather than praising the virtues of their respective cultures or races. The guiding principle was the belief in the equal worth of all individuals, connected by our shared human experience or, to be more specific, nationality, regardless of our skin colour or subculture.</p><p>However, with the rise of new social movements, the pursuit of “recognition” for various groups has come to the fore. These groups sought validation as full members of the human race, united by our common humanity. "Recognition" was used to define the unique needs of different marginalised groups, including racial minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals. But regrettably, the concept of recognition has shifted to mean the acknowledgment of cultural and racial differences or the intrinsic value of diverse races and cultures, rather than the affirmation of a shared human experience.</p><p>I believe we should return to celebrating our common humanity and stop propagating the idea that cultures and races inherently possess value simply because of their perceived existence. I feel we'd be better off focusing on eliminating prejudice and stigmatization — essentially, instances of cruelty — and treating everyone as full-fledged members of the human race.</p><p>Maybe we should radically reevaluate our language and the way we frame our discourse with respect to populations that were previously marginalised, like remove the concepts like "race" and "caste" from our collective lexicon, ceasing the division of humanity based on genealogical descent. The aim here is to lessen the likelihood of the question "who are his or her ancestors?" being posed. We’ve already done something like this; we removed terms such as "noble blood,", “pure blood”, "mixed blood," "outcaste," "intermarriage," "untouchable," and the likes because we believe the world would be a better place if assessments of suitability - for marriage, employment, or public office - were made purely on the basis of individual behaviour, not influenced by one's lineage.</p>
