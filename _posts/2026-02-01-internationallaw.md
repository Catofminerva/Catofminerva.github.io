## The Recent 'Death' of International Law 

One of the most intractable debates in international legal theory is whether international law is really ‘law’ in the relevant sense. This question has, particularly over the past two years, moved from the seminar-rooms into mainstream political commentary, largely because so many high-profile violations of international law have seemed to carry so little cost. Israel’s conduct especially has been widely described by critics as a pattern of serious international legal violations, including genocide, unlawful occupation and unlawful uses of force against multiple sovereign states, and which has gone effectively unpunished. Recent United States strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, the kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, and the confrontation over Greenland after Trump publicly floated coercive acquisition have likewise been taken by many commentators as evidence of a drift back toward a pre-1945 world of spheres of influence. The events have frequently been described as ushering the death of the ‘rules-based order’, a phrase that Western states often prefer because it carries less of the language of obligation that comes with 'international law'. 

These events have moreover been construed by so many on the Left as merely reinforcing the view of IL as an instrument of Western hegemony that is consciously discriminating, a colonial relic continuous with the nineteenth-century 'standards of civilisation', later rebranded under the titles of 'modernisation' and 'development'. On this view, it has always functioned as a normative device that divides 'the West' and 'the rest'. For the former, it is a tool for post hoc rationalisation of state conduct. For the latter, it is toothless at best. The sceptic will only go as far as concede that it may be an 'ideological' or 'moral' force in the world, one which is being tarnished, but it certainly is not 'law'.

## International Law can be Selectively Enforced, Colonial and Ineffective - but still Law
These sceptics are partly right about the background conditions of IL, but not on its legal status. They are right that IL does not exist in abstraction from the historically specific spatial and political nomos of the earth, one which (following Carl Schmitt) makes particular patterns of land appropriation and organised violence intelligible. This nomos plausibly is changing, at least in domains where great powers contest territorial settlement and the definition of war. The actions of the US and its allies are contemporary symptoms of a contest over this nomos. When the sceptic claims that we are reverting back to an older order, she is referring to the nomos in which one polity treats its territory as 'the world' (the zone where law exists) and where everything beyond is marginal unless it is threatening. Violence against outsiders was not governed by a shared interstate code because there was no shared space of coexistence. Law is merely internal; the external is managed through domination, expediency or exceptional categories. When the United States (and its proxies) had becomes the new sacral center that shaped the war-definition and the spatial settlement post-1945, IL, in its hegemonic application, was increasingly interpreted and selectively enforced in ways that tracked this order. And the simple idea that current sceptics call attention to is that legal norms presuppose a normal situation, a nomos (in exceptional situations, laws may are thrown out - as in war-time when martial law is invoked, which is essentially the suspension of law for military rule). The prevailing nomos, they argue, is disrupted - no longer is normal, such that in domains where war-definition and territorial settlement are contested, no one really can really any longer predict structured uptake of standards. 

These political and historical facts are very important, and their evasion by virtue of being bogged down in 'neutral' ontological debates about the nature of law is unfortunate and a large part of what milquetoast liberalism in fact attempts to do. But at no point does it follow from these facts that IL is therefore not 'law'. Calling a system 'law' does not entail that it satisfies the rule of law nor that it is non-discriminatory nor that it is evenly enforced. Those are all normative claims about legal quality and legitimacy. Whether IL is law is however a conceptual claim. Even a colonial or hierarchical or racist order can instantiate legal form. What this legal form does in practice (whether it constrains power, channels it or supplies it with a vocabulary of legitimacy) is orthogonal to its status as a legal form. British India *had* laws. The Antebellum South *had* laws. Nazi Germany *had* laws. In other words, how well something performs is a different sort of claim from what *kind* of thing it is. 

This is a similar category mistake when it comes to morality. People often take a substantive evaluative complaint (“their ‘morality’ is vile” “their principles are inconsistent” “they don’t live up to what they profess”) and slide to an ontological denial (“therefore they have no moral principles at all”). All groups, from the nazis and the slaveholders to feminists and human rights activists, have moral principles. One might condemn those moral principles as being incongruent with their own or their groups' principles, one may think that they are selective and seldom enforced or are often hypocritical and contradictory, or make some other evaluative claim. But the inference from those evaluative claims about morality to an ontological claim about their existence is not borne out.

A large share of the current dispute is therefore really two disputes:

1. **A conceptual dispute:** what counts as law?
2. **A normative dispute:** does international law genuinely constrain power or does it mostly rationalise it?

A lot of sceptical arguments glide from (2) to (1). They start with a disappointment about constraint and conclude by denying legal status. However, we can only grant this if we assume a particular concept of ‘law’.

## Municipal Law and the Coercion Criteria

The conception of 'law' is taken by the sceptic to be based on the municipal, vertical image of law, where a sovereign issues rules, a legislature enacts them, courts interpret them, police enforce them and subjects comply under threat of sanction. IL is then judged by how much it resembles this order. Since it lacks a general legislature, a unified executive and a monopoly of force, it is demoted into 'morality' or 'politics'. This is essentially John Austin’s famous account of law as the command of a sovereign backed by sanctions. Under Austin’s account, IL fails because there is no world sovereign, no global Leviathan standing above the relations of states. It follows from the view of absolute sovereignity of states that all rules are consent-based, and in virtue of this, they cannot be deemed law. International law therefore can only be 'positive morality'.

Setting aside the contention about absolute sovereignity (states are not in fact absolute sovereigns for example on developing rules and arbitrating on matters relevant to the use of force, self-determination and human rights, nor are they so in principle as is fleshed out in Article 2 of the UN Charter where states are recognised as equal sovereigns) a vertical, centralised system is an odd standard to impose on IL because IL is built for a (formally) horizontal society of (formally) equal states and not for subjects living under a superior authority in the manner presupposed by municipal law. Consent plays a different role because the relevant community is not a single political unit with a general lawmaker. Formal equality, of course, does not entail an absence of hierarchy, and IL contains conspicuously vertical sites, often unfair ones. Though post-colonial states may not have inherited the political and economic clout from their former colonies when they attained sovereignity, they are nevertheless sovereign in the sense that they are the ultimate authority on national matters, whether or not this is realised in practice (Croatia did not, for example, lose its sovereignity when it joined the EU in 2013 and stopped having ultimate say in certain matters). 

Still, the contrast between municipal and IL is structural, a difference of form across a spectrum of legal systems, not a difference in *kind*.

It is not enough of a problem for Austin’s definition that it is parochial in this way, in which he construes ‘law’ to fit a particular image of the state as the only possible *kind* of law. What is more of a problem is that this construal finds counter examples even within the municipal system of law, in which much of what we call law does not involve coercion coercion. There are such things as constitutional limits, broad standards and principles, institutional roles, and the mere existence of private and customary law - all of which often coordinates expectations rather than punishing wrongdoing. Austin’s construal then excludes major parts of what ordinary legal practice treats as law, such that if coercion and a sovereign monopoly were conceptually necessary conditions, huge chunks of domestic legality would become mysterious. Under this command theory of law, moreover, it is unclear why legal argument constrains officials who are, in practice, positioned to ignore it.

## Reason-giving and Recognition as Criteria

Another famous conception of ‘law’ was offered by H. L. A. Hart. Hart posits two rules that make up law; primary rules, which concern the imposition of obligations, and secondary rules, which concern rules abbout rules, i.e., how the primary rules are identified and judged (rules of recognition). Hart believed that primary rules are present in international law but that secondary rules - rules not contingent for their existence on other rules - are absent, thus making international law a kind of psuedo law. On Hart's construal, then, law is 'grounded' based upon a social rule, the rule of recogniton, as the standard of identifying when a law is law. Hart's appraisal of international law as lacking secondary rules however seems erroneous, if only due to the signficance of such instruments as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which systemetically provides the rules of treaty-making and is habitually relied upon by domestic and international courts. 

Rules exist as rules, in the legal sense, when relevant participants treat them as standards that can justify, guide and criticise conduct. The key contrast is between regular behaviour as habit and regular behaviour under a norm-guided posture, where deviation is treated as a reason-giving failure and not merely a surprising event. International practice fits this posture in the sense that international legal advisers, judges, diplomats, treaty negotiators, domestic courts applying treaties and arbitral panels all operate within a shared field of legal reasons. Even strategic, norm-violating actors frequently present their conduct as legally justified. Actors prefer to abide by the law rather than break it and there seems to be something genuinely distinctive as a kind of criticism when a state does indeed embark on such a course of conduct and its actions are described as ‘unlawful’ as opposed to ‘immoral’.  

‘Legality’ is therefore something of a public standard. When states breach, they often still behave as if legality demands some sort of account, whether self-defence, consent, countermeasures, necessity, treaty interpretation, reservations, jurisdictional limits or scope arguments. Open admissions of illegality are rather rare. The fact that actors feel compelled to offer legal justifications, and that audiences evaluate those justifications by recognisable criteria, is part of what makes the practice legal in the relevant sense. Under this construal, law is 
> a sustained, organised form of reason-giving in which participants treat certain source-forms as generating public standards, treat interpretive moves as admissible or inadmissible, and accept that departures call for justification or attract criticism. 

What remains to be said about the dispute concerns the degree and distribution of constraint and not whether a legal practice exists as such. I find it therefore hard to discern any interesting *ontological* distinctions between IL and municipal law, and the differences people like to point out seem to be entirely normative and political - as when people tend to describe an 'underdeveloped' state as 'lawless'. When pressed, it is unlikely that those people would seriously make the claim that the laws in placet are not actually 'laws', but that they're just bad laws, or that that 'lawlesness' is used rheotrically to judge against what they consider to be a good legal system, with criteria such as impartiality, rule of law, transparency, due process and etc.

A sceptic can retort that “Legitimacy talk is useful, and so actors merely dress their behaviour in legal language”. True, however the point already grants the central conceptual point that IL is embedded in a practice where legal reasons are treated *as* reasons that must be addressed.

Another retort may be that IL may need not look like municipal law but enough coercion/enforcement still seems to be a necessary condition of what ‘law’ is, otherwise we remove all the ‘oomph’ and teeth from what we want the law to do. Perfect enforcement is of courrse not a necessary condition, otherwise we would also have to grant that a spike in crime would make criminal law cease being law. But international law contains just this sort of enforcement. We may not appreciate it because lot of conformity is routine and therefore invisible. Breaches and spectacular violations generate headlines while everyday compliance does not. Many regulatory and coordinative areas (shipping, aviation norms, diplomatic immunities, cross-border finance and ordinary treaty performance) operate precisely because compliance is nothing exceptional. It is in the interest of states, in an inter-dependent world which requires stable, predictable and authoritative regime of conduct, to comply with IL. The sceptic seems to only think of 'law' as the criminal law sort of law, with crime and punishment anaologised with municipal systems, and overlooks that there are endless permutations of law and much of what goes on in law is not merely criminal law. 

## Who’s Afraid of a Semantic Dispute?

A remaining worry remains that if the argument becomes “it is law because people call it law” the sceptic can respond that labels are cheap and we are merely having a semantic dispute. The response is this is indeed a semantic dispute and not an ‘essence’ dispute, and that semantic disputes are very important because concepts stretch into institutions, authority and modes of life. ‘Is international law really law?’ is answered by examining the role the concept plays in justificatory and institutional life. The usage-based conception is indexed not not the median speaker on the street, which often has messy, politically loaded and often deferential to power usage of the concept. The relevant usage is that of the relevant linguistic community, the structured uptake by participants who occupy recognisable institutional roles (judges, legal advisers, treaty drafters, domestic courts, arbitral tribunals), expressed through relatively stable criteria for sources, interpretation and permissible argument.

This is how to answer a semantic dispute. We can move from this descriptive point to conceptual engineering by asking what we want the concept ‘law’ to do for us, and by redescribing it in ways that improve explanation, prediction, coordination, criticism, institutional design and legitimacy contests - or what have you of best criteria. In that sense, there is a genuine disagreement about how to characterise 'law', but the disagreement is constrained by a 1) descriptive aspect about what best captures the salient features of the phenomenon and 2) a normative aspect about what yields the most fruitful distinctions.
