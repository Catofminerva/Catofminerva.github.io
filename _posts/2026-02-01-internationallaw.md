One of the most intractable debates in international legal theory is whether international law is really ‘law’ in the relevant sense. From one jurisprudential point of view the conclusion appears to be a set of familiar observations which finds that international law works through institutional practice and inherited patterns of interpretation, and it is assessed with one eye on coherence and another on consequence. If that is all the question amounts to, then what is left to talk about the nature of international law amounts to a debate about semantics.

Nevertheless, this question has acquired fresh heat. Over the past two years it has moved from seminar-rooms into mainstream political commentary, largely because so many high-profile violations of international law have seemed to carry so little cost. Israel’s conduct has been widely described by critics as a pattern of serious international legal violations, including genocide, unlawful occupation and unlawful uses of force against multiple sovereign states, and which has gone effectively unpunished. Recent United States strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, the kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, and the confrontation over Greenland after Trump publicly floated coercive acquisition have likewise been taken by many commentators as evidence of a drift back toward a pre-1945 world of spheres of influence. The events have frequently been described as ushering the death of the ‘rules-based order’, a phrase that Western states often prefer because it carries less of the language of obligation that comes with 'international law'. 

These events have moreover been construed by many on the Left as merely reinforcing the view of IL as instrument of Western hegemony that is consciously discriminating, a colonial relic continuous with the nineteenth-century 'standards of civilisation', later rebranded under the titles of 'modernisation' and 'development'. On this view, it has always functioned as a normative device that divides 'the West' and 'the rest'. For the former, it is a tool for post hoc rationalisation of state conduct. For the latter, it is toothless at best. The sceptic will only go as far as concede that it may be a major 'ideological' or 'moral' force in the world, but it certainly is not 'law'. 

A large share of the ontological dispute, however, is really two disputes run together:

1. **A conceptual dispute:** what counts as law?
2. **A normative/sociological dispute:** does international law genuinely constrain power, or does it mostly rationalise it?

A lot of sceptical arguments glide from (2) to (1). They start with a disappointment about constraint and end by denying legal status. However, we can only grant this slide if we assume a particular model of ‘law’ as the only ‘true’ model.

## Municipal Law and the Coercion Criteria

A common hidden premise is a municipal, vertical image of law: a sovereign issues rules, a legislature enacts them, courts interpret them, police enforce them, and subjects comply under threat of sanction. IL is then judged by resemblance to that picture. Since it lacks a general legislature, a unified executive, and a monopoly of force, it is demoted into 'morality' or 'politics'. This is essentially John Austin’s famous account of law as the command of a sovereign backed by sanctions. Under Austin’s account, IL fails because there is no world sovereign, no global Leviathan standing above the relations of states. International law becomes merely 'positive morality'.

If one defines law as a vertical, centralised system, IL appears deficient by definition. But that is an odd standard to impose, because IL is built for a largely horizontal society of formally equal states, not for subjects living under a superior authority in the manner presupposed by municipal law. Consent plays a different role because the relevant community is not a single political unit with a general lawmaker. Formal equality, of course, does not entail an absence of hierarchy, and IL contains conspicuously vertical sites, often unfair ones. Still, the contrast between municipal and IL is structural, a difference of form across a spectrum of legal systems, not a difference in metaphysical *kind*.

It is not enough of a problem for Austin’s definition that it is parochial in this way, in which he construes ‘law’ to fit a particular image of the state as the only possible *kind* of law. What is more of a problem is that this construal finds counter examples even within the municipal system of law, in which much of what we call law does not function as day-to-day coercion. There are constitutional limits that constrain officials who already control the machinery of enforcement; broad standards and principles that guide decisions through institutional roles and reasoning; and private law often coordinates expectations rather than punishing wrongdoing. Austin’s construal then excludes major parts of what ordinary legal practice treats as law, including customary law (a standard counterexample) and large domains of constitutional constraint.

What’s more, if coercion and a sovereign monopoly were conceptually necessary conditions, huge chunks of domestic legality would become mysterious. More importantly, the command theory struggles to explain why legal argument constrains officials who are, in practice, positioned to ignore it. So, denying IL’s status because it lacks a global police force imports a dubious theory of law and then celebrates the import as a discovery.

## Reason-giving and Recognition as Criteria

Another famous conception of ‘law’ was offered by H. L. A. Hart. Rules exist as rules, in the legal sense, when relevant participants treat them as standards that can justify, guide and criticise conduct. The key contrast is between regular behaviour as habit and regular behaviour under a norm-guided posture, where deviation is treated as a reason-giving failure and not merely a surprising event. International practice fits this posture in a distinctive way in the sense that international legal advisers, judges, diplomats, treaty negotiators, domestic courts applying treaties and arbitral panels all operate within a shared field of legal reasons. Even strategic, norm-violating actors frequently present their conduct as legally justified. States prefer to abide by the law rather than break it and there seems to be something genuinely distinctive as a kind of criticism when a state does embark on such a course of conduct and its action are described as ‘unlawful’ as opposed to ‘immoral’.  

‘Legality’ therefore acts as a public standard. When states breach, they often still behave as if legality demands an account, whether self-defence, consent, countermeasures, necessity, treaty interpretation, reservations, jurisdictional limits and scope arguments. Open admissions of illegality occur but they are comparatively rarer than legalised justification. A better, because more accurate, starting point is therefore that law is a family of institutionalised normative systems. ‘Family’ is operative here as it refers to the fact that legal systems vary in structure while still sharing enough conditions for the category to obtain.

A sceptic can retort that “Legitimacy talk is useful, and so actors merely dress their behaviour in legal language”. True, however the point already grants the central conceptual point that IL is embedded in a practice where legal reasons are treated as reasons that must be addressed. The remaining dispute is then mainly sociological and normative, about how strong the constraint is, not about whether a legal practice exists - that is, the ontological status of it is undisputed.

Another retort may be that IL may need not look like municipal law but coercion/enforcement still seems to be a necessary condition of what ‘law’ is, otherwise we remove all the ‘oomph’ and teeth from what we want the law to do. While perfect enforcement is orthogonal for legal existence (if it were a necessary condition then we would also have to grant that a spike in crime would make criminal law cease being law, which is absurd), some minimal efficacy requirement with a broad and ongoing threshold seems plausible, as opposed to centralised enforcement capacity or near-perfect compliance. On this standard, international law plausibly qualifies across many domains. A lot of conformity is routine and therefore invisible. Breaches and spectacular violations generate headlines while everyday compliance does not. Many regulatory and coordinative areas (shipping, aviation norms, diplomatic immunities, cross-border finance and ordinary treaty performance) operate precisely because compliance is the default rather than the exception. It is in the interest of states, in an inter-dependent world which requires stable, predictable and authoritative regime of conduct, to comply with IL. The sceptic seems to only think of 'law' as criminal law, with crime and punishment anaologised with municipial systems, and overlooks that there are endless permutations of law and much of what goes on in law is not merely criminal law. 

## Who’s Afraid of a Semantic Dispute?

A remaining worry remains that if the argument becomes “it is law because people call it law” the sceptic can respond that labels are cheap and we are merely having a semantic dispute. The response is this is indeed a semantic dispute and not an ‘essence’ dispute, and that semantic disputes are very important because concepts stretch into institutions, authority and modes of life. ‘Is international law really law?’ is answered by examining the role the concept plays in justificatory and institutional life. The relevant usage here is not the median speaker on the street, which often has messy, politically loaded and often deferential to power usage of the concept. The relevant usage that of the relevant linguistic community, the structured uptake by participants who occupy recognisable institutional roles (judges, legal advisers, treaty drafters, domestic courts, arbitral tribunals), expressed through relatively stable criteria for sources, interpretation and permissible argument.

We can move from this descriptive point to conceptual engineering by asking what we want the concept ‘law’ to do for us, and by redescribing it in ways that improve explanation, prediction, coordination, criticism, institutional design, and legitimacy contests. In that sense, there is a genuine disagreement about how to characterise the practice, but the disagreement is constrained by what best captures the salient features of the phenomenon and what yields the most fruitful distinctions. Yes, it is a semantic game, but it is a game with rules set by shared purposes and by the resistant structure of the practice itself. The fact that actors feel compelled to offer legal justifications, and that audiences evaluate those justifications by recognisable criteria, is part of what makes the practice legal in the relevant sense. Thus, the conception of law to which IL clearly fits is: a sustained, organised form of reason-giving in which participants treat certain source-forms as generating public standards, treat interpretive moves as admissible or inadmissible, and accept that departures call for justification or attract criticism. This is a social fact about how the practice runs and not a metaphysical property that only municipal systems can possess. The remaining dispute concerns the degree and distribution of constraint and not whether a legal practice exists as such.
