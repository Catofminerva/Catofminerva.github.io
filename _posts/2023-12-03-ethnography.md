==================================================

When Romania’s communist regime fell in 1989, its successor state flung open the vaults of the Securitate to citizens and foreigners who wished to confront the traces of their surveilled lives. Among them was Katherine Verdery, an American anthropologist whose doctoral field work into Transylvanian villages had, unbeknownst to her, become a subject of decdes lond paranoid statecraft. Her research, being as it is, anthropological, had dealt with the ethnographic details of rural life; she had not, she insists, arrived with the cloak-and-dagger intent her file-minders ascribed to her. Yet in those in reams of yellowing paper she was intriguied to find intimate photographs snapped from shadows, informants’ whispers, dossiers charting her movements as though she were a “mischievous American spy”, as one report declared.

No single motivation explains this paranoia. This was perhaps a case of seeing what you expect to see, particularly when your occupation primes you for it. As Verdery reads her files, she finds that, during the heights of the Cold War, her minders had pegged her as a US spy. As tensions with Hungarians in Romania later escalated, she was reframed as an American spy with Hungarian roots, a Magyar sympathiser. And when internal dissidents came under closer scrutiny, she became an instigator of civil discord. The state contorted her identity to fit its pathologies.

Anthropology and Espionage
--------------------------

That Verdery recounts this with the wry detachment of a bemused archivist rather than an indignant victim perhaps owes to her discipline’s fraught kinship with espionage. Both infiltrate communities, both collect detailed anthropological information. The difference, one might argue, is in ethics committees and peer review. But history muddies such distinctions. It was 1919 when Franz Boas set off a scandal by accusing unnamed colleagues of conducting espionage in Central America during World War I. He published his accusations in a letter in _The Nation_, condemning those who had “prostituted science”. His outraged peers feared that such revelations would taint legitimate research. Yet Boas’s own student, Ruth Benedict, later gathered what the U.S. government termed 'cultural intelligence' on Japan during World War II, then worked with institutions like the RAND Corporation and the Office of Naval Research in the Cold War era. More recently, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) struggled with the moral quandary posed by the 'Human Terrain System', a controversial U.S. military initiative that embedded anthropologists in Afghanistan and Iraq for counterinsurgency work. Despite the AAA’s ethical guidelines, anthropologists continue to find themselves in corporate and governmental programs that bring them uncomfortably close to surveillance or the extraction of sensitive information.

That Verdery was not at shock is understandable given the history of a discpline, let’s recall, was birthed in colonial outposts and war rooms and emerged as a handmaiden to empire. Malinowski’s Trobriand ethnographies were funded by the Australian government during World War I. Evans-Pritchard’s Sudanese fieldwork doubled as colonial intelligence-gathering. Even Boas relied on grants from museums and universities entangled with state interests.

The Securitate’s inability to imagine Verdery as “just a scholar” is at the same time a critique of positivist anthropology, of the naïveté of believing any research can reach out from under under ideology, and that the act of documenting human behaviour is inherently political, even (especially?) when the observer believes themselves apolitical. Anthropology’s tools (fieldnotes, interviews, cultural analysis, kinship charts, ritual descriptions, oral histories) are always vulnerable to serve multiple masters. To study a culture is to dissect it and to dissect is to assert dominion (knolwedge is power, etc.). Good fieldwork (embedded observation, close relationships, cultural fluency) is good intelligence-gathering. The Securitate’s delusions about Verdery, then, were reflections of anthropology’s original sin.

How could Verdery—or any of her perceived alter-egos—definitively argue against the notion that she was, in some sense, a spy? Her research did yield sociopolitical data which lead her to conclusions that didn't necessarily flatter the Ceaușescu regime. The secret files ultimately leave Verdery questioning her own perception of her identity, asking “with all these identities was I “the same” person?”. Her answer is a resolute “…no. There were several of me, at any one time (the child, the surrogate daughter, the researcher, the department chair, “the Folklorist,” etc. and across time as well.”

Multiple Selves
---------------

In Luigi Pirandello's novel _One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand_, the protagonist Vitangelo Moscarda's world is upended when he learns, through his wife, that his nose is not as perfectly shaped as he believed. This seemingly inconsequential self-misperception of his physiognomy, in which his “self” is supposedly encased, spirals into a desperate quest to uncover other illusions about himself. Throughout his journey in 'discovering' a stable sense of selfhood, Moscarda finds that he is indeed an outsider to himself, appearing one way to himself and another to others.

But that is not the end of his misery because even this outsider is not univocal. Moscarada comes to learn “of the hundred thousand Moscardas that I was, not only for the others but also for myself, all with this one name of Moscarda. Ugly to the point of cruelty all inside this poor body of mine, that was also one. One and alas no one.” He finds that one is a certain someone, but only from a specific perspective: a lovable fool to siblings, a ne'er-do-well to teachers, a deceptive partner to an ex, a warm presence to parents… a crafty spy to the espionage operatives. This multiplicity makes it such that is is impossible to identify a single, unadulterated version of ourselves. There is no omniscient perspective, no intrinsic essence, an "I-particle" from which one could chisel out the "true" self.

Verdery had worked quite hard to construct an identity of herslef as 'Verdery the Ethnographer' and not 'VERA the American Spy'. Others create their own versions of our identity which we cannot fully control. When a significant dissonance arises between these internal and external constructs—as when you construct for yourself the identity of a serious academic out to conduct serious research, while others construct that same identity as a treacherous spy—it can drive some to the brink of frenzy, crying out to the world "I AM NOT A SPY, I AM AN ETHNOGRAPHER". Verdery found herself face-to-face with various strange doppelgängers who she vehemently denies being—the ‘Folklorist’ or ‘VERA’, a cunning, calculating spy, at times disguised as a Hungarian. The second half of the book is a series of difficult reunions as she speaks with a number of the individuals who informed on her​. This is Verdery's attempt to finally kill her doppelgängers.

State Surveillance and the Cold War
-----------------------------------

The book’s premise is the discovery and analysis of one's secret file, a kind of meta-research - studying the study of oneself while one was conducting studies on others. Interspersed within is the near-comical schizophrenia of the secret police (“patriots … defending the positive image of their country”) who viewed each benign act through a prism of suspicion. Verdery effectively showcases this contrast by juxtaposing her academically-oriented field notes and innocent enough personal diary notes with those of the surveillance officers.

The files are also a story about the Cold War era where the personal is inevitably political. In one poignant reflection, Verdery acknowledges that the Cold War made spies of everyone and no one. Romania’s Securitate was one of the most pervasive surveillance apparatuses in the Eastern bloc – by some estimates between 400,000 and 700,000 informants served a population of 20 million. Nearly half a million citizens were spying on their neighbors. One is reminded of Michel Foucault’s famous depiction of modern surveillance: “An inspecting gaze, a gaze that each individual under its weight will end by internalising to the point that they are their own overseer”. Verdery stood little chance of escaping suspicion.

Ironically, then, the state authorities in Romania were dealing with the same fundamental problem that Verdery herself faced, i.e., the challenge of reconciling the identity they had perceived internally with the version others in the capitalist or non-aligned blocs perceived from the outside.

If she had wanted, Verdery could have easily become complicit – had she secretly cooperated with the CIA during her fieldwork (which would not have been surprising), for instance, the Securitate’s suspicions would have been vindicated. But she did not. Yet the language of state power meant that she suffered the consequences anyway, as if she were guilty by association with a long lineage of less scrupulous scholars.

How should an anthropologist respond upon learning that some of her dearest friends and interlocutors were coerced into betraying her? With anger? Forgiveness? Understanding? Verdery approaches them with an anthropologists' empathy, those "sympathetic interpreters who could place their behavior in the context of an unfamiliar set of beliefs and desires", in philosopher Richard Rortys' description of anthropologists. There were certain historically contingent conditions that made ordinary people be complicit in a network of deceit. It is not a story of the 'good (american)scholars versus bad (communist) police'.

Though over the decades, the anthropological community has slowly inched toward a reckoning with the issues of complicity through various official 'codes of ethics' that caution against secret research and dual-loyalties and so on, yet, as historian Joelson writes, for too long “American anthropology avoided facing the ethical questions Boas raised about using research as a cover for spying”​. Again and again, anthroplogists are complicit in state atrocities, such as in Project Camelot and Vietnam.
