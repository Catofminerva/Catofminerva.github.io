<div class="exported-content"><h4><strong>A Reluctant Pilgrimage to Pharaoh's Realm</strong></h4><p>It was with a mixture of dread and excitement that I received my marching orders from the higher-ups. A mission to Cairo, Egypt. The land of pyramids and sphinxes seemed worlds away from the drab office where I had been toiling day in and day out. The silver lining, of course, was the handsome paycheck that would accompany this sojourn to the sands of the Nile. My task was simply to attend a conference on the somewhat nebulous subject of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in the Middle East. Attendance and nothing else.</p><p>This was not to be my first Egyptian escapade. My childhood was peppered with intermittent visits to Alexandria, a legacy of my mother's academic pursuits in the early 2000s. Alas, my recollections of that time are few and far between, with only the cacophony of street merchants hawking their potatoes and the discordant symphony of car horns lingering in my memory.</p><p>Since those halcyon days, Egypt has undergone a transformation of sorts. The once-great pinnacle of Arab civilisation is now mentioned with a caveat that something has happened in recent years where it had stagnated in development; that it now constitutes a somewhat backward province in the Arab world. What the reason is for this is rather difficult to say. Some attribute it to the aftereffects of Sadat’s economic liberalisation and the unending parade of questionable regimes, military dictatorships and their irresponsible socio-economic policies. Others attribute this to external geopolitical forces and global economic conditions, such as the end of the Cold War, the rise of new regional powers, specifically in the Gulf, and shifts in global trade dynamics, which have collectively marginalised Egypt within the Arab world and beyond.</p><p>Not being a competent historian <em>cum</em> political scientist, I do not wish to volunteer too much. Nevertheless, for some reason or another, Egypt failed to advance with the age in the way that some neighbouring states had done. Some Egyptian friends of mine do not wish to think of themselves in this light but even their own accounts seem to betray their wishes. </p><h4><strong>Of Glorious Heights and Fallen Empires</strong></h4><p>Once upon a time, Egypt stood as a dazzling jewel in the Arab world's crown, straddling the realms of the <em>Mashriq</em> and the <em>Maghrib</em>, a beacon of brilliance and sophistication. A vibrant panel of literature, art, music, fashion, and science unfurled across the land, drawing together the glitterati of high society, aristocrats, and celebrities. As the cultural Mecca of the Arab world, the cafes of Heliopolis hummed with the melodies of Um Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez, while patrons sipped Turkish coffee and soaked in the electric atmosphere. Giza's nightlife was the envy of the region, with mesmerising belly dancers commanding the stage, and Cairo's streets teemed with life, a testament to its status as the cradle of Arab art.</p><p>Egypt was the birthplace of Arab intellectual, artistic and musical genius, of renowned philosophers, artists, literary authors and scientists. The Egyptians were as progressive, as liberal and as bountiful in their contribution to Arab culture, literature and art as anyone else. Ambitious scholars from across the Middle East and North Africa flocked to its illustrious universities in pursuit of knowledge and prestige—among them my mother, a proud Qatari whose father served as the first ambassador of Qatar in Egypt. </p><p>Although my journey to Egypt was tinged with reluctance, I couldn't help but feel a spark of curiosity. Was it truly possible that this once-magnificent realm had faded into obscurity, leaving behind only echoes of its storied 'golden age'? It was a question that gnawed at me as I embarked on my voyage, eager to witness firsthand the contrast between Egypt's past splendour and its supposed present reality.</p><h4>A Journey Fraught with Uncertainty</h4><p>As if the prospect of returning to Egypt weren't daunting enough, the spectre of a global pandemic - responsible for claiming nearly five million lives - loomed ominously over my impending trip. I was assured that Egypt had all but vanquished the dreaded virus, although whispers persisted that it was merely being ignored, dismissed as a sham or overshadowed by more pressing concerns. Regardless, the tragic loss of my Egyptian coworker's both parents to the virus, right in the heart of where I would soon set foot, did little to allay my fears.</p><p>Compounding my trepidation was the political quagmire that had engulfed Egypt and Qatar for over four years. With diplomatic ties severed and vitriolic rhetoric spewed forth from state-run media, the recent restoration of relations was a fragile, tenuous thing. As an official representative of Qatar, I couldn't shake the gnawing anxiety that my presence in Egypt might be met with hostility or suspicion.</p><p>Indeed, I would be one of the first of my nationality to venture into Egypt amid this diplomatic maelstrom. How would the Egyptian authorities receive me? This lingering uncertainty prompted a resolution: to maintain a low profile and seek refuge within the confines of my hotel for the duration of my stay.</p><p>And so, with a heavy heart and a suitcase full of apprehension, I embarked upon my journey to the land that had once been synonymous with greatness—‘the mother of the world’ as one aggrandising adage would have it—eager to uncover the truth behind its storied past while navigating the treacherous currents of the present.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg" width="1076" height="798" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:798,&quot;width&quot;:1076,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc526f29d-776b-43a8-ad77-81ecc879cf40_1076x798.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Alexandria, circa 2001. Grandad (left), dad (center), me (right).</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>A Symphony of Chaos: First Impressions</strong></p><p>I found myself both bemused and confounded by the unrelenting pandemonium that greeted me upon arrival. While I hadn't anticipated a full-blown culture shock, I couldn't help but wonder if my sheltered upbringing had left me unprepared for this messiness. From the moment I disembarked the plane to my eventual arrival at the hotel, chaos reigned supreme, an absurd and entertaining spectacle that mirrored the accounts of those who had ventured here before me.</p><p>The airport fiasco was merely the opening act. Before setting off, I had been briefed by fellow officers and a Public Relations officer from the embassy, who seemed intimately familiar with the ins and outs of Egypt's unofficial "hustle and bribery" economy. I was advised that, should I wish to expedite my document verification process, a little "extra" would grease the wheels. With a mix of trepidation and curiosity, I obliged, and to my astonishment, the unprincipled (and undoubtedly illicit) transaction worked like a charm!</p><p>A shadowy figure in a suit promptly whisked me away to a nondescript car, and as we sped towards a nearby airport building, I couldn't help but entertain paranoid (and, in hindsight, likely unfounded) fears of abduction due to my nationality. My journey through the airport bureaucracy continued in a whirlwind, as I was passed from one staff member to another like a hot potato, until finally, I found myself ensconced in what can only be described as the world's dreariest lounge. The austere, dimly lit room stood in stark contrast to the frenzied demeanour of the staff who were all seemingly suffering from wild paroxysms, darting about as though perpetually pressed for time, perhaps eager to extort their next hapless victim.</p><p>I found myself amidst a flock of trained sycophants. Courteous and friendly on the surface, their gestures reeked of insincerity—a curious breed of self-seeking fawning that went beyond the garden-variety clerk or salesperson.</p><p>"Ah, Effendi," one would croon, eyes gleaming with the promise of potential profit. "Hadrat, a pleasure to meet you," another would chime, a thinly veiled attempt to coax the wallet from my pocket.</p><p>I couldn't help but detect the inauthenticity of their praise, but I also recognised the desperate lengths people go to when faced with poverty. With a shrug and a bribe, I breezed through security and found solace in the embrace of a diplomatic car waiting outside the airport.</p><p>As the car whisked me away, I gazed through the window, absorbing the peculiarities of this ancient land. Lopsided, pale, and dilapidated buildings stretched before me like a chaotic symphony of concrete and rebar. These weary sentinels stood in stark contrast to the glistening, state-of-the-art hotels peppered throughout the cityscape. The presence of such hotels evoked a bygone era of refined western exploration, when distinctions between home and foreign lands, urban and rural, East and West, and central and remote regions were more prominently defined.</p><p>A sudden interruption of military installations jolted me from my reverie. Every other block boasted a formidable fortress, adorned with war paintings, nationalistic slogans, and the unblinking eyes of El-Sisi staring down from his lofty bridge perch. These symbols of military rule stood as a testament to the curious intersection of rational modernism, atavistic traditionalism, and militarism that defined the architectural iconography of the nation.</p><p>There was no shortage of high quality interactive entertainment on the road. At nearly every stop, beggars would tap dance upon our car windows and doors, offering unsolicited prayers and chuckle-worthy quips in exchange for coins. One particularly bold lady showered me with compliments and a marriage proposal, to which I replied, "I'm flattered, but perhaps we should get to know each other first." Our diplomatic plates transformed our Mercedes Benz into a beggar magnet, the shiny emblem a siren call for extorting eyes.</p><p>As we navigated Cairo's crumbling streets, the symphony of horn-happy drivers provided a relentless soundtrack. I gazed longingly at a bustling marketplace we passed, now a wistful missed opportunity. Alongside it, a mosaic of tiny shops clung together like siblings, each proudly bearing its owner's name, regardless of the wares within. I pondered whether their inventory mirrored their uniform facades.</p><p>The east bank of downtown Cairo introduced us to its local canine population: a parade of scrappy, sunbathing strays. My heart swelled as Tahrir Square, that iconic bastion of revolution, unfolded before me—a sight hitherto relegated to the flickering screen of my television. We crossed the historic Qasr El Nil bridge, flanked by bronze lions and stately obelisks, as if traversing the very spine of Egypt's past.</p><p>Along the Nile's shores, antiquated malls stood under the watchful eyes of rifle-toting officers and their K9 companions. It seemed every corner of Cairo bore the indelible mark of police and military presence, the city's very fabric stitched together with the threads of authority. The experience was a trip in a time machine, catapulting me back to the Cairo of the 1990s, its charm frozen in a bygone era.</p><p>In the shadow of military dictatorship, I found myself both captivated and disoriented by the omnipresent security. Cairo, a city steeped in history and strife, revealed itself to me in all its complex splendor—a place where the unexpected was commonplace, and the past and present danced a slow, entwined waltz.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg" width="449" height="566" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:566,&quot;width&quot;:449,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cac203a-17db-46f5-b661-c39726fa599d_449x566.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Tahrir Square from the hotel room balcony window.</em></figcaption></figure></div><h4>The Mesmerising Madness of Cairo's Roads</h4><p>In the cacophonous heart of Cairo, a symphony of honks and hollers fills the air, an urban concerto performed by a chorus of vehicular virtuosos. Cars weave in and out of lanes with the grace and precision of synchronised swimmers, their honks a language all their own. I marvelled at this unique, chaotic dance, unlike anything I'd ever witnessed.</p><p>Pedestrians, fearlessly defiant, jaywalked the city's busiest arteries, their steps a balletic act of faith. And somehow, the cars complied, swerving and honking their reluctant acquiescence. This intricate dance rippled through the traffic like a chain reaction, a domino effect of vehicular evasion.</p><p>Though painted lines marked the boundaries of lanes, they seemed more like mere suggestions than rules. Drivers steered their metal steeds with reckless abandon, guided by whimsy and instinct. The scene was both astonishing and unnerving, a mesmerising spectacle of danger.</p><p>Yet, amidst the pandemonium, I saw no accidents—testament to the adaptability of the city's denizens, who had learned to navigate the madness. The streets of Cairo were akin to a stampeding herd of cattle: awe-inspiring to behold, but a dance best left to the natives.</p><h4>The Hotel of Unmasked Revelry</h4><p>As I entered the hotel, I couldn't help but marvel at the fact that people willingly chose to spend their vacations amidst such chaos. A pungent miasma of perfume, cigarettes, and alcohol hung heavy in the air, as maskless crowds of khaleejis swarmed the lobby like bees to a hive.</p><p>The pandemonium continued as I embarked on the Sisyphean task of checking in. Drunken shouts and line-cutting interlopers vied for attention, while the understandably irritable staff struggled to maintain some semblance of order. It felt like a schoolyard teeming with unruly, cash-flush children on a playground run amok.</p><p>In this tumultuous atmosphere, the specter of COVID seemed a distant memory. The hotel was a time capsule to pre-pandemic days, a paradoxical sanctuary from the world outside. I stood out like a sore thumb, my face mask a glaring testament to my adherence to the "old ways."</p><p>Most of the few mask-wearing souls I spotted were staff members, likely mandated to don the protective gear. Even among them, many masks dangled precariously, noses peering over the top, rendering the entire exercise a futile, almost comical, display.</p><p>As I navigated this strange new world, I clung to my mask and my principles, refusing to succumb to the pressure. In the midst of revelry and abandon, I found a small, defiant sense of purpose.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg" width="1044" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1044,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ea9f1fd-1a34-4a65-9a6f-e63b07f92434_1044x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>I spent most days in the hotel.</em></p><h4>A Tête-à-Tête with the Ambassador</h4><p>A meeting with the Ambassador of [redacted] in Egypt was arranged, and I was informed that he was eager to meet the grandson of the first-ever ambassador from [redacted] to Egypt. A cocktail of excitement, nervousness, and anticipation churned within me, tempered by the Ambassador's warm words of welcome.</p><p>Upon arrival, I was met with a small reception at the embassy before being ushered into the Ambassador's office. The grandiose space demanded immediate formality, with its marble floors and shelves adorned with an eclectic array of trophies, medals, and plaques—mementos from fellow dignitaries.</p><p>At the far end of the room, a short, rotund man with a bushy moustache sat behind an imposing desk, clad in a traditional thawb and headwear. The Ambassador rose graciously, greeting me with cordiality and decorum. I reciprocated, expressing my gratitude for his time and company.</p><p>As we embarked on conversation, it took a few moments for our discourse to find its rhythm. My nerves had subsided, but I remained overly cautious, striving for a degree of formality that bordered on stifling. The Ambassador, however, exuded a cheerful casualness, unpretentious and good-natured.</p><p>He did not quite fit the mold I had envisioned for someone in his position, lacking the polish and sophistication I had anticipated. His amiable ignorance on certain matters also caught me by surprise. Yet, in his unassuming demeanour, I found an unexpected sense of comfort, a reminder that even dignitaries are, at their core, only human.</p><p>The Ambassador's keen interest in my grandfather's legacy as his predecessor was evident, but I felt compelled to steer the conversation elsewhere, uncomfortable with the attention it drew from those around us. My curiosity lay more in the ambassador's role itself than in the man, who seemed rather unremarkable, just another archetype devoid of any unique qualities.</p><p>Eager to delve into the intricacies of his position, Egypt, and the geopolitical complexities surrounding the country, I posed various questions. However, he appeared more inclined to discuss trivial matters, such as the weather.</p><p>When I broached politics, the Ambassador seemed to require backup, as if rallying the troops. A flurry of phone calls later, a parade of men materialised, eager to acquaint themselves with a familiar, [redacted] face in a foreign land.</p><p>The conversation took an unexpected turn, with each man contributing his own unsavoury anecdote about the opposite sex. Perhaps it was some misguided form of male bonding, or maybe it simply aligned with the stereotypes of my countrymen. Regardless, my respect for them dwindled with each chauvinistic remark.</p><p>The blatant misogyny on display, particularly when the female secretary happened to pass by and overhear the conversation, left a bitter taste in my mouth. I couldn't help but wonder if she had grown accustomed to such disregard, but that realisation brought me little comfort.</p><p>The Ambassador then launched into a diatribe about how the ministry was now overrun with women, lamenting their perceived incompetence as employees and their alleged unscrupulous tactics in securing maternity leave. He waxed nostalgic about the days when women were not allowed to work at all, but then felt compelled to clarify that the Foreign Office, in particular, was an unsuitable workplace for women, as one could hardly think it acceptable to post a woman Ambassador in foreign countries to go about entertaining members of the opposite sex.</p><p>As he spoke, I could feel my expression hardening. Still, I feigned agreement and conformity to avoid any awkwardness or exclusion due to my opposing beliefs. I also hoped to build a rapport with the Ambassador for future opportunities.</p><p>“Beautifully argued your Excellency,” I found myself commenting with forced alacrity after he was done with his little polemic, “you put the case most expertly—I couldn’t have said it better myself. We are facing the exact same issue in our own Ministry when it comes to maternity leave. Something ought to be done about it”.&nbsp;</p><p>I then added without much in the way of reflection, "Likewise when it comes to Defence, woman simply do not have the natural faculties to control and command our obstinate soldiers, not least our Generals, and I hate to even begin to imagine what would be said about us with a woman as head of Security". For extra points I finished it off by saying, "After all, the prophet Muhammed warned us that Allah curses a nation led by a woman". </p><p>I was proud of my newfound talent for sycophancy. I wondered if this was a natural result of being in Egypt. However, in retrospect, perhaps I should have remained silent or chosen a different approach, expressing some disapproval on principle. But adhering strictly to one's principles doesn't make one an Ambassador.</p><p>Despite the overt sexism and the lack of vegan options at lunch, the encounter was generally pleasant. What began with uneasiness, formality, and stiffness on my part ended with jokes, laughter, and an exchange of business cards. Before bidding farewell, I presented the Ambassador with a commemorative plaque to add to his extensive collection.</p><h4>The Grand Diplomatic Charade</h4><p>Ah, the conference—a predictably uneventful occasion, replete with pomp and circumstance. These highfalutin gabfests resemble nothing more than toothless, diplomatic Drones Clubs, where states agree to disagree on matters predetermined before anyone even sets foot in the venue. The odds of a foreign office altering its stance based on a prepared speech (or, as they're fond of calling them, dialogues) are about as likely as a cactus breaking into spontaneous tap dance.</p><p>The unofficial mantra of these elaborate charades is "Don't rock the boat; Tomayto, tomatho, right?" And with that, it's off to the next conference in some chic metropolis that doubles as a vacation hotspot for the well-heeled delegates.</p><p>The script, you ask? Oh, it's a predictable affair. Diplomats clutch carefully crafted, tediously vague transcripts—penned by some beleaguered intern who's merely substituted a few key phrases from a previous address. Each diplomat then takes their turn to drone on about the usual platitudes: commitment, cooperation, and the inevitable "blah blah blah." It's a veritable symphony of jargon and cliché.</p><p>And as for audience engagement? Forget about it. Most attendees are either snoozing, scrolling through their phones, or grazing on complimentary canapés in the hallway. And that's if they even bother to show up. Some diplomats, it seems, would much rather soak up the sun poolside or embark on a shopping spree, leaving their hapless junior delegates to endure the mind-numbing spectacle.</p><p>Somehow, we've managed to convince ourselves that these grandiose gatherings serve a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of global affairs—or at least that's the party line we toe. But who could blame us for perpetuating the myth? After all, we're treated to sumptuous feasts, elegant attire, and ample opportunities to rub shoulders with our esteemed peers—all while flashing toothy grins for the cameras and adding new connections to our ever-expanding rolodexes. And the pièce de résistance? It's all on the taxpayer's tab.</p><p>One can't help but wonder if these international soirées were invented purely to provide delegates and emissaries with a pretext for embarking on 'overseas missions,' a clever euphemism for state-sponsored globetrotting. And I must admit, even as I recognise the inherent absurdity of these affairs, I can't deny the allure of basking in their opulence and the guilty pleasure of playing the part of a world-shaking dignitary.</p><h4><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h4><p>In conclusion, my Egyptian sojourn has been a veritable odyssey of cacophonous streets, gastronomic misadventures, and a kaleidoscope of human interactions, both delightful and dismaying. This business trip has been a crash course in adapting to the relentless chaos while appreciating the nuggets of charm and camaraderie hidden beneath the surface.</p><p>Given more time, I would have loved to explore the temples and museums, which could have provided a more balanced perspective of the country. Egypt may indeed be the perfect destination for some travellers who revel in the chaos, the heat, the questionable culinary offerings, and the omnipresent cloud of pollution. If you're the type of person who thrives on the adrenaline rush of navigating treacherous streets, fending off persistent salespeople at every turn, and engaging in a constant battle of wits with everyone from Uber drivers to airport personnel, then Egypt may just be your ideal vacation spot.</p><p>But for those seeking a more tranquil, serene experience, it may be wise to look elsewhere. And so, as I bid farewell to this land of enigma and dust, I take with me a newfound appreciation for the quiet orderliness of my homeland and a collection of colorful anecdotes that would make even the most stoic Pharaoh chuckle.</p>
